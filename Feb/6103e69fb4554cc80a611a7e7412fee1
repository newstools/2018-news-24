The state-owned Herald newspaper reported that Chigumba was sworn in as Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) chairperson on Thursday in the capital Harare. She took over from Justice Rita Makarau who resigned in December. According to reports Makarau stunned the southern African country when she quit her job without giving any reasons for her resignation. Unnamed sources said that it appeared as if she had been pushed to leave her job. "It appears as if she may have been pushed. Her email signalling her intention to resign came as a complete shock to us. It came after we had an important meeting with one of our stakeholders during the week, and there was no sign that she was on her way out... In fact she was as calm and cheerful as she always is,” an unnamed source was quoted as saying at the time. Opposition parties were also "surprised and concerned" over Makarau's sudden departure.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
