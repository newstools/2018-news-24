The World Bank and IMF froze aid to Mali that year over state dealings with the supplier Guo Star, and over a separate purchase of a $40m presidential plane for leader Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. Accusations over the tender process and overbilling tainted the deals. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent

The court said in a judgement made available on Monday that the state should pay Guo Star just over 25 billion CFA francs ($47m), representing the balance of the contract. It also ordered the state to pay 600 million CFA francs in damages and interest. A lawyer representing the firm said on Monday his client had "respected the contract signed". The state auditor had ordered the government in 2014 not to pay the supplier until enquiries into the corruption allegations were completed. The separate case of the presidential plane remains under scrutiny by investigators. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
