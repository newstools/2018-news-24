Amahle Maliwa, 28, and Liziwe Ngwayishe, 33, appeared in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Wednesday, where they are accused of the murder of Njabulo Mankayi and his friend, Luyanda Msomi. Mankayi's decomposed body was found on November 13 in the Grunter Gully Canal in Bayhead, south of Durban and Msomi's body was found in the bush in Montclair, Durban on November 11. They were both Grade 3 pupils at Clairwood Boys Primary School and were last seen alive on November 9, while boarding a bus from home. Maliwa and Ngwayishe are charged with murder, kidnapping and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The same charges were withdrawn against a foreign national, who was accused of helping them to poison and murder the two boys.

Motala ordered that he be taken to a police station, where he was to be immediately charged. Motala said the women's bail applications could not proceed because the investigating officer in the matter had to first verify the existence of the alternative address they would live at if they were to be released on bail. Their Legal Aid lawyer said both of them gave her the same address – which is Maliwa's brother's home. The State said it would oppose bail. Both women are still in custody at Westville Prison and the case was postponed to March 13. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
