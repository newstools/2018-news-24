THE Pietermaritzburg Regional Court convicted and sentenced Mandla Hamilton Hlophe (37) to 14 years imprisonment for rape, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and kidnapping. He was sentenced to 10 years for rape, three years for kidnapping and one year for assault. On December 19, 2012, at 9.30 pm, the victim was at her friend’s house in the Bulwer area when she was approached by the accused. The accused requested the victim to accompany him but she refused as she had previously been stabbed by the same accused. He then threatened to kill her and she was forced to go with him to his place of residence where she was raped. A case of rape, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and kidnapping was opened at Bulwer Police Station for further investigation. The docket was transferred to the Plessisslaer Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. The accused was later arrested and charged accordingly. Bail was opposed successfully and the accused remained in custody until he was sentenced. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, welcomed the sentence handed down to the accused. “I commend the unit for their outstanding investigation that assisted in making sure that the accused remains in prison and is kept away from the community,” Langa said. — Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
