The authenticity of the 23-minute video posted late on Sunday on websites known to be sympathetic to the group could not be independently verified, but appeared similar to past releases by the group. It makes a brief mention of an ongoing offensive by security forces against IS, suggesting it was made after the campaign began on Friday. The video showed what appeared to be footage of past IS attacks in Sinai and the killings of unarmed off-duty soldiers or men suspected of collaborating with security forces. President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi's re-election is virtually assured in the March 26-28 vote. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
