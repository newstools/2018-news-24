Judge Luka Kimaru also orderered Kenya's government to return the passport confiscated from Miguna Miguna when he was deported. Miguna was at Odinga's side when he took an oath as the "people's president" last month in a protest against President Uhuru Kenyatta's re-election. The government responded by arresting opposition politicians and shutting down TV stations broadcasting the event. Odinga claims that results in last year's August election were manipulated in Kenyatta's favor, and he boycotted a fresh vote in October after the Supreme Court nullified the first one, saying electoral reforms had not been made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
