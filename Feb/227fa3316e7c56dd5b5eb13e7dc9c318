The UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the allegations were received last week by the UN peacekeeping mission in DRC. He said the UN welcomes the South African Defence Army's commitment to investigate the allegations. According to information at this time, Dujarric said the three allegations of sexual exploitation allegedly took place in Sake, Beni and Goma in eastern Congo's volatile North Kivu region "and involve adult victims, one of which includes a paternity and child support claim". He said the alleged attack on the 17-year-old boy took place in conflict-wracked Kasai and he was referred to Unicef for immediate assistance.
