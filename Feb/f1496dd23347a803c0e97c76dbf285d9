Speaking to News24 on Friday, Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi said President Cyril Ramaphosa was now their commander-in-chief, following the resignation of Jacob Zuma as president of the country on Wednesday. "The new president is our new commander. We were reminded that we only support people who are in power, even if we don't like them. If you are a soldier, you uphold the Constitution." Mgobozi said the soldiers were reminded during an address by General Solly Shoke and the Military Command, while taking part in the Armed Forces Day 2018 celebrations in Kimberley in the Northern Cape. He said every time there was a change in leadership, they are reminded that they serve whoever is in charge, irrespective of their personal beliefs. The event was aimed at celebrating the steadfastness and bravery displayed by former and current serving men and women of the SANDF. It was also a commemoration of the sinking of the SS Mendi on February 1917. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
