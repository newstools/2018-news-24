According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Mnangagwa was in Botswana on a state visit. Mnangagwa toured the world renowned Diamond Trading Company (DTC) that would assist Zimbabwe in polishing, cutting and valuing its diamond. The DTC is regarded as the world's most sophisticated diamond sorting and valuing hub. Its arrangement with Zimbabwe would likely see the southern African nation sending its vast diamond to Botswana for processing, cleaning and polishing before being sold. The move would see the country's diamond make better returns than their current price of $50 per carat, the report said.
