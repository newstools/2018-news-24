He made the claim after prosecutor Mornay Julius cross-examined him on the testimony of a hotel employee. "After two years and seven months since the incident, I have discovered a strange moment," said Novella. "The mixture of substances on the night of July 28, 2014 - since that moment, something beyond myself took possession. "An entity took possession of Gaby and myself." Novella previously testified that he and Alban had consumed Cannabis oil, dagga and sceletium on the night before the murder. "It is possible that the substances led to a certain percentage of memory loss, but this was a possession. A demonic entity took both of us," Novella told the court. Saldanha asked Novella to clarify whether the use of substances led to demonic possession. "After mixing the substances it opened another dimension to allow these demonic entities to take possession of Gaby and myself." Novella also said that he had been in contact with a psychic medium from KwaZulu-Natal, who confirmed to him that he was indeed possessed at the time of Alban's murder. Novella had previously testified that he had killed a "demonic entity" who was, in actual fact, Alban. The trial resumes on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
