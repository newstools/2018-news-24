Three officers were killed at the police station. The gunmen then separated the female police officers from their male counterparts, before taking six pistols, two shotguns and two assault rifles. The retired soldier was shot dead as they fled. The bodies of two additional officers were later found, shot execution style, along the roadside near Nyanga High School, about 6km from the police station. Ngcobo is situated between Mthatha and Queenstown. Tonjeni previously said a task team, which comprises among others, detectives, the Hawks, Crime Intelligence, as well as the Tactical Response Team's tracing unit, had worked through the night, following the massacre. The task team had gone through the crime scene with a fine-tooth comb, looking for clues and analysing evidence collected, he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
