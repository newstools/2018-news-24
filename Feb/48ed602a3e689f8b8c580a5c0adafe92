Iavan Pijoos Johannesburg – Five awaiting trial prisoners accused of murder are still on the run after the truck transporting them from court to prison on Monday was ambushed in Johannesburg, police said on Tuesday. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Lungelo Dlamini said, while the men were on their way back to prison from the High Court, suspects in a silver-grey BMW ambushed them, using high calibre firearms on the Golden Highway in Johannesburg. "They [suspects] shot at the truck with rifles until it lost control," Dlamini said. He added that the driver of the truck was shot and wounded in the lower body. He is in a stable condition at hospital. Two of the escapees, Mike Dube and Sifiso Dlomo, were part of a group of men who allegedly shot and killed a policeman Frans Malesela Ledwaba in March 2015, during an armed robbery of bakery at Johannesburg Park Station. The other three men, Simphiwe Mutswane, Mxolisi Mazibuko and Mzwakhe Thabethe, are awaiting trial for the killing of two policemen in Dobsonville. Warrant officer Samuel Mchizana and Solly Maluleke were killed in September 2015. "Both members were attached to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit and were on routine investigation when they were killed. The officers’ firearms and dockets were stolen during the attack," he said. A photo of the fifth prisoner was not immediately available.
