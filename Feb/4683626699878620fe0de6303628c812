Mokhtar Mounir told The Associated Press on Monday that police forces have arrested Mohamed el-Kassas, the deputy head of the Egyptian opposition party Misr al-Qawia, four days ago and raided his home in Cairo. He said el-Kassas is held in solitary confinement in Cairo's sprawling Tora Prison complex. No trial date has been set. It is the latest in a crackdown on opposition overseen by President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi who led the military's 2013 ouster of Egypt's first freely elected leader, the Islamist Mohammed Morsi. The crackdown has led to the imprisonment of tens of thousands of dissidents. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
