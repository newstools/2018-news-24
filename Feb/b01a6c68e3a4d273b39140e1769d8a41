The official says the move is in response to South Sudan's humanitarian crisis and that the restrictions effectively amount to a "domestic arms embargo." The official wasn't authorised to discuss the situation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The United States is also calling on South Sudan's neighbours to implement similar arms restrictions and urging the UN Security Council to support a global embargo on the country. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
