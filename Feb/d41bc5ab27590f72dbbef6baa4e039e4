Mohlaloga, who was appointed chairperson of Icasa in December 2017, was found guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in January. The court found that he defrauded the Land Bank of about R6m in 2008. He acted with at least three other accomplices to transfer the money from the Land Bank to an attorney's trust account. He and his co-accused are expected to be sentenced on April 3. Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Communications Humphrey Maxegwana, said the committee would remove him after he was convicted. "Out of respect [for] the rule of natural justice, the committee will inform him about the decision and give him five working days to explain why he should not be removed from Icasa," said Maxegwana. He said the process would be instituted in terms of the Icasa Act. Fin24 previously reported that Mohlaloga was appointed to the previous Icasa board in 2013, despite the fraud allegations. He has served as acting chairperson of the Icasa board since 2016. He is also a former deputy president of the ANC Youth League and served as an ANC MP. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
