The pair was warned to appear at the Bloemfontein High Court on March 2, Hawks regional spokesperson Captain S'fiso Nyakane said in a statement. Leeto, who is being touted as one of the frontrunners to replace Ace Magashule as ANC Free State chair, and Moorosi handed themselves over to the Hawks in Bloemfontein on Thursday. In 2009, Leeto was the mayor of Matjhabeng municipality when she allegedly awarded a tender of R15m to procure photocopy machines and to install telephonic systems as well as CCTV cameras for the municipality, allegedly without following correct tender processes. At the time Moorosi was the chief financial officer at the municipality. It is also alleged that the two received "gratification" from the company. Leeto was previously arrested and the case was withdrawn after her lawyers made representations. The CEO did not face charges at the time. Following investigations, the charges were reinstated for the MEC. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
