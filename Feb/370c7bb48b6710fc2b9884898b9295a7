He took to Twitter to announce that a new investigation team would be working on the case. “There's a new investigating team on Senzo Meyiwa case, I briefed Senzo’s Father and I asked him not to speak out. I can assure everyone we on it. #JusticeForSenzoMenyiwa [sic[,” he wrote. This announcement comes after an anonymous parody Twitter account, @AdvBarryRoux, concluded what might have transpired on the night of the goalkeeper’s murder in singer Kelly Khumalo’s mother’s home almost four years ago. @AdvBarryRoux’s post that was shared a week ago led to the trending of the hashtag #JusticeForSenzoMeyiwa and South African tweeps got Mbabula to get the case moving again. After not responding for a week, the minister has finally said something. Check out some of his responses below:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
