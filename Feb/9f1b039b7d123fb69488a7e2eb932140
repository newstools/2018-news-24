The reshuffle was delayed by almost two hours, but eventually he announced the return of former finance minister Nhlanhla Nene to the same portfolio and the introduction of others, such as Dr Zweli Mkhize to the position of Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta). Ramaphosa also announced that David Mabuza would be appointed as his deputy. He is to be sworn in on Tuesday. READ: Who is our new deputy president-elect David Mabuza?
