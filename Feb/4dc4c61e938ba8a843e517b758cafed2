Cape Town – US President Donald Trump took to Twitter on Tuesday to praise the South African-born entrepreneur, Elon Musk, on his successful SpaceX rocket launch. The world's most powerful rocket – the Falcon Heavy rocket, which was built by Musk’s exploration company, SpaceX – blasted off on its journey towards an orbit near Mars on Tuesday. - WATCH: SpaceX launches world's most powerful rocket toward Mars Musk became the chairperson of Tesla – an electric carmaker – in 2004 and it was a Tesla roadster that was sent into orbit from a Cape Canaveral launchpad. He also serves as the chief executive officer and chief technology officer of SpaceX. Trump was delighted with the successful launch, claiming that Musk and SpaceX represent the "best of American ingenuity". Which is quite interesting, given that Musk is originally from a "shithole" country. In January, Trump reportedly referred to Haiti and African countries as "shithole countries". He suggested that the US should not accept immigrants from these countries, but instead welcome immigrants from countries like Norway. The United Nations slammed the comment as "shocking and shameful". Trump later implied that he did not make any such comment or use language of that nature.  Here are some of the responses to Trump's tweet.   Musk later tweeted his thanks to Trump.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
