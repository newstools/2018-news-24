The Amanzimtoti Crime Prevention Unit’s Warrant Officer Booysens and Constable Moodley, with the assistance of CCPO, removed the dagga plants and sent them for destruction. The SAPS encourages the community to report any related incidents as quick action can then be     taken in order to stop drugs from hitting the          streets. Captain Van Der Spuy, communications officer for Amanzimtoti SAPS, said: “Substance abuse is but one of the concerns in our area. “Every pro-active action taken changes a life and together we can do so much more to address these challenges we face on a daily basis.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
