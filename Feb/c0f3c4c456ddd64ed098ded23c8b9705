IF an appointment to renew your drivers licence or professional driver permits (PrDP) is your preference, a new system is in place at the Uitenhage and Korsten Traffic and Drivers Licensing Centres. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Member of the Mayoral Committee for Safety and   Security, Cllr John Best, said this manual booking system, where residents can either call in or make an appointment at the departments, is a temporary pre-cursor for a fully-fledged online booking system and a smartphone application. “We decided to implement the temporary call-in and walk-in booking system ahead of the digital booking systems to find a quicker way to alleviate the long queues plaguing service delivery at the centres. “The immediate implementation of the temporary booking system will be a great help to those who cannot wait in lines due to time constraints and ailments. “Three machines will be dedicated in   Korsten to the new booking system and one in Uitenhage. Each machine will accommodate twenty-eight bookings per day “In addition to the booking system, residents who prefer to stand in the queue to be serviced, can continue to do so as well. “Other improvements to the current service delivery model include a third Traffic and Drivers Licensing Centre at the Motherwell Thusong Service Centre, two centres where drivers licences can be renewed and proposals from our IT technicians to improve the Department of Transport-owned computer system at our traffic departments,” said Best. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
