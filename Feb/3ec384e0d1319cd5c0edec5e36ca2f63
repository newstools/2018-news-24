Mbalula was speaking at the Manguzi Stadium in the northern KwaZulu-Natal town of Manguzi on Friday, a few kilometres away from the Kosi Bay border that separates South Africa and Mozambique. "Between the two governments – the Minister of Police and the Minister of Police in Mozambique, together with the two generals - we are going to meet and put an extradition treaty in place to ensure that the criminals hiding in Mozambique will be sent back to South Africa to stand trial," he said. The minister also spoke about recent developments alongside the border. "We arrested 14 police officers who were suspects in criminal activity and corruption alongside the border," said Mbalula. "We have upgraded the station [on the border] and we put a new police force in place, and we are also going to upgrade in terms of our operations, from the point of view of the police, in fighting crime in this particular area." Plans have also been set in motion to construct a fence along the border to hinder criminal activity, he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
