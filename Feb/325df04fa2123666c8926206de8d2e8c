President condemns attacks Earlier on Thursday, at the Presidential Gold Day, President Cyril Ramaphosa spoke about the incident. He said he was pleased that people had not simply moved on from the attack, but that they were appalled and wanted it to be solved. "In the past people would have just accepted it as they moved on, but this time they say 'no'." He said he was pleased with Mbalula's commitment to make arrests in the matter within 72 hours, saying this was how the government needed to act. "And this is the new way that we want to do things in our country now. Start things on time, get things done timeously, and when there is a disaster like [that], it should be attended to with maximum speed." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
