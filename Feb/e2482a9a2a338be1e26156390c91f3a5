Qobolwakhe Justice Gumbi, 29, went to the teenager’s home in Msinsini near Port Shepstone on December 2, 2013, where he beat her with an electrical cord, according to police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. "He stuffed her mouth with a towel, preventing her from screaming out for help," said Gwala. Gumbi also threatened her with a knife and fired a warning shot as a form of intimidation. Upon investigation, it was revealed that the suspect was being held in Durban, charged with armed robbery which occurred in Verulam in 2015. The charges were later withdrawn, according to a statement. "Unfortunately for him, he could not escape the penalties for the crime he committed against an innocent vulnerable child in Msinsini and had to stand trial for his dreadful deeds," said Gwala. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa said he was pleased with the outcome of the case. "This sentence shows that the detective team has been diligently working on the case," he said. The court ruled that Gumbi’s name would be recorded in the National Register of Sex Offenders and that he would never be able to work in an environment involving children. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
