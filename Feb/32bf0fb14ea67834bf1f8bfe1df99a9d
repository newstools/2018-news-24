The young girl was abducted and raped after being sent on the errand by her mother on the evening of January 29, said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "Upon arrival at home, the victim reported the ordeal to the mother who immediately reported it to the police." Ngoepe told News24 that the man was arrested on Monday when the police linked him to the crime. He is set to appear in the Motetema Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. "The South African Police Service in this province condemns these types of acts, especially when [they are] perpetrated by adult persons who are supposed to protect them [children]," said Ngoepe. He also encouraged members of the community to "join hands with the police" and protect children from any form of abuse or harm. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
