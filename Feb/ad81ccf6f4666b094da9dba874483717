A delivery man was robbed at gunpoint in Military Road, Steenberg last Tuesday. Steenberg police spokesperson, John Bartlett, says the complainant was standing outside his company delivery vehicle, a white Mercedes Benz, when he was approached by three men. “One of the suspects took out a firearm and forced the complainant into the vehicle. The second suspect was handed the keys and he drove the vehicle to a back street, where a grey VW Golf with registration number 440839 was waiting.” Bartlett says cigarettes with an estimated value of R120 000 were loaded into the awaiting vehicle and the suspects then fled in the Golf. “The suspects also took the keys of the complainant’s vehicle. The vehicle belongs to a tobacco transporting company. “No shots were fired and no arrests have been made. A case of robbery with a firearm has been opened for investigation,” he says. V
