Ian Gross, NSRI Table Bay duty coxswain, said the Table Bay crew had responded to the Marina at Bascule, at the V&A Waterfront, shortly after 08:30 on Friday to investigate reports of an accident at a yacht at a berthing there. “Information about the accident was unclear and as a precaution NSRI Table rescue swimmers and NSRI Table Bay medical crew responded,” he said. Gross said when they arrived, a private ambulance service was already in attendance. He said V&A Waterfront security staff and NSRI crew assisted the paramedics to treat the woman for injuries sustained from a fall from a yacht mast, where she had been working. He said she had sustained a suspected fractured shoulder and a laceration to her leg. Gross said the woman was transported to hospital by ambulance in a stable condition. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
