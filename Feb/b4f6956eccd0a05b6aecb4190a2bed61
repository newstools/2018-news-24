For nearly three years, Uber has been operating illegally in Morocco - despite currently having 19 000 users in Morocco and over 300 drivers. In a statement Uber said "as long as there is no real reform ... we are forced to suspend our operations." Uber drivers have often been targets of intimidation. Videos have captured Uber drivers in Casablanca surrounded by regular taxi drivers, awaiting the authorities, and in some instances the clashes have become violent. Bouchaib Abdel Moughit of Casablanca's Taxi Union voiced relief at Uber's departure: "For three years, they stole our living. The competition was unfair."
