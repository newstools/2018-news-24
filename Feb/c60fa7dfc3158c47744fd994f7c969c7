In the 10-minute video released on Wednesday, Abubakar Shekau says his militants weren't defeated in the Sambisa forest of northeastern Nigeria. Shekau tells the camera "if you have killed us, why are we still alive?" At one point the head of Boko Haram calls himself "invincible" and vows to continue his fight to establish an Islamic caliphate. At the very end though, he also makes clear: "I am tired of this calamity; it is better I die and go to rest in paradise." It wasn't immediately clear when or where the video was made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
