In a statement late on Sunday, it says it is still working to ensure that the hundreds of families taking refuge in a camp near the town of Bani Walid can return to their home city, also known as Tawergha.

Local media had reported that the Tawergha, who were due to return on February 1 under an agreement with neighbouring Misrata, were barred from entry by militias who fired in the air and even shot up some cars. Misrata militiamen blame the Tawergha for siding with Libya's longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi during the 2011 uprising that overthrew and killed him. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
