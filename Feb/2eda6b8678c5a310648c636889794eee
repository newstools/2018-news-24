The accused allegedly had an argument with his girlfriend, Phindile Khuzwayo, at her Richmond farm home in October 2017 before he allegedly murdered her and her sister, Hlengiwe Khuzwayo, said provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. "While Phindile was in the house, she was involved in an argument with her boyfriend who allegedly shot her to death. "When her sister [Hlengiwe] came for assistance, she was also shot at by the suspect. She was rushed to hospital where she later died of her injuries." The accused fled the scene, but was arrested at his Newlands home on Friday, where he was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Two counts of murder were opened at Ntuzuma police station for further investigation. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the police officers for their work. "We also appreciated information from the community members who always provide valuable information about criminal activities in the province," said Langa. "The recovered firearm will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if it was used in any other crimes in the province." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
