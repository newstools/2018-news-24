Rather it is how we ensure that our people will have equitable access to land." #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) #Ramaphosa: "A Mr Alberts who I spoke to in Cape Town, said his home was forcibly removed from him, and the pain is still there today. What do we say to him about his home?""Give him a house," some DA MPs shout. #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) #Ramaphosa now references the "original sin" mentioned by DA leader Mmusi Maimane, of land being taken away. "We are called to heal the pains of the past. It is a collective task. It is not the task of the ANC alone. It belongs to all." #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) Ramaphosa says the reality is that young white people are not disadvantaged by affirmative action policies. White men still dominate senior positions in ecomomy. "That can not be denied." #SONA2018 @TeamNews24 #Ramaphosa: We respect those who have worked to build and believe that SA belongs to all who live in it. #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) #Ramaphosa says South Africa has made progress in racial disparities, but "we still have a long to go." #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) #Ramaphosa: As government, we have the responsibility to build consensus. We have the responsibility to work together. #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) "What we are about is to build consensus. We want South Africans to lend a hand." - President Cyril Ramaphosa #SONA2018 (@gerbjan) Ramaphosa addressing EFF criticism that he "doesn't have a plan": I have a plan, it is called the National Development Plan. ANC MPs shout "Yes!" #SONAreply (@PaulHermanCPT) Jump to
