The cut-off date of November 30, 2017 was first extended to January 31, 2018 and then on Wednesday to February 15, 2018. Last week GroundUp reported that some Zimbabweans risked missing the January 31 deadline to apply for a ZEP because of a bureaucratic hurdle. In a press statement, Home Affairs stated that by January 29, 2018, a total of 176 605 applicants had completed the process, which includes keeping their appointments with VFS and submitting supporting documents and biometrics. The extension to February 15, 2018 was only for submitting fingerprints and supporting documents and for applicants who had submitted online applications by November 30, 2017 but had not paid the prescribed fee, the department said. "New applications will not be accepted. By the end of September 2018, the department plans to have completed the whole project, including finalising adjudications and issuing out of all new permits." The department said by the closing date for online applications, November 30, 2017, a total of 196 006 applications had been received. No applications were accepted after the closing date. (Editor's note: According to the department's figures for applications received and completed applications, it would appear that over 19 000 people have until February 15 to complete the process.) The Zimbabwean Special Permit (ZSP), which started in 2014 with 197 951 permits issued, expired on December 31, 2017. ZEP permit holders will be allowed to work, study or conduct business in South Africa. The permits are valid for up to four years from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2021. "Exemption permits, like the ZEP permits, are not permanent or long-term. They only serve a specific purpose with a view ultimately to have people returning to their countries of origin, to build their lives anew," said the department. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
