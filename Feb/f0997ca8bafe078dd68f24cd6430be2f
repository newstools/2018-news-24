"This will send a strong warning to the would-be criminals who think of committing the same crime and abusing vulnerable children. I further thanked the community members who came and assisted the victim, but discouraged them from taking the law into their own hands," Acting Provincial Commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa said. The Empangeni Regional Court sentenced the 51-year-old man on Monday after he was convicted of the rape of a 6-year-old child on June 3, 2017 in Matshana. READ: Trial date set for grandparents, cousin accused of rape, sexual assault Police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the child was raped in her grandmother's home. "She was raped by the accused in the house. While the accused was busy raping the victim, a relative unexpectedly entered the house and caught the accused on top of the victim. Community members were alerted and they came for assistance." Zwane said the community allegedly assaulted the man, but he escaped. He was later arrested after an investigation by the Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit.
