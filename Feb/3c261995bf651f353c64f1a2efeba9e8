"Currently, efforts are under way to classify the drought as a national disaster," Van Rooyen said at a media briefing in Cape Town. "This process will be finalised on or before February 14, 2018." He said the process of declaration was prescribed in the Disaster Management Act. The three provinces - the Northern Cape, Western Cape and Eastern Cape - have already been declared provincial disasters. The first step in terms of the act, would be to reclassify them national disasters. The regulations linked to the act might touch on by-laws and guidance on procurement, so the department will move to identify impediments on spending given to all provinces to deal with the situation. It also became clear that the department might have to look into supply chain issues, which slowed some water initiatives down.
