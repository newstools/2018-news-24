A drying room was found at the back of a house in Hely Street when officers responded to the explosion at 06:50, police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said. Numerous shelves of abalone, a gas cylinder and a fan was discovered in one room, while another contained a large number of containers filled with shucked abalone. Van Wyk said the equipment, which also included burners, scales and bags of salt, would be seized. "The buildings were extensively damaged by the explosion. Two neighbouring houses were also damaged."
