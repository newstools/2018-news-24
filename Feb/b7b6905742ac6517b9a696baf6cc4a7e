Tsvangirai, 65, the veteran Zimbabwean opposition leader who fought Robert Mugabe's regime for many years, died on Wednesday after battling against cancer. Tsvangirai, who founded the MDC in 1999, was among the most prominent critics of Mugabe, the long-time authoritarian leader who was ousted from power in November. In an interview with News24, Chamisa said that the MDC was set to meet on Thursday to discuss the way forward after the death of the veteran leader. "We've just received the news, we are conveying a meeting. We're going to see how we are going to move forward tomorrow (Thursday). We're going to issue a statement," said Chamisa. Activists also expressed their shock, with Patson Dzamara saying that although he knew about the former trade unionist's battle with cancer, he had not expected that he would die "before the country crossed into a democratic dispensation that he helped many Zimbabweans believe in".

"In as much we all knew that he was not well, it's hard for all us. We've lost a train of hope. He led us to believe that we can stand up against tyranny. He inspired all of us with his bravery. He was the first person to stand up for justice and freedom. We've lost our trail blazer. We were not ready. I am hurt, I am sad that he has left this way. But, we accept that God has passed his judgement," said Dzamara. Social media users reacted with fond memories of the veteran leader. Some remembered him as a kind and devoted icon who stood firm for his believes. The colossus of the struggle for democracy in Zimbabwe & beyond has fallen! The people's hero is gone. May your dream materialize in our lifetime. Thank you for making me believe that change is possible, the courage & to fight for it, & an opportunity to.
