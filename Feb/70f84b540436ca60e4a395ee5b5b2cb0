SPECIAL REPORT: #GuptaLeaks The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) has revealed a list of vehicles linked to the Gupta family. These include a Porsche linked to former president Jacob Zuma's son, Duduzane Zuma and a Maserati Quattroporte worth R1.1-million. Outa has also revealed vehicles registered to companies associated with the Guptas, including Sahara and TNA Media Head Office. The whereabouts of all the vehicles are unclear, as the Hawks investigate the Gupta family's business dealings. This came as Outa revealed on Friday that more Gupta-linked
companies have filed for business rescue, after the family's Optimum Coal
operations filed for business rescue earlier this month. READ: More Gupta-owned companies apply for business rescue Earlier this month, the Hawks arrested several business
associates of the Guptas in connection with their involvement in the Estina
dairy project in the Free State. The Hawks have issued a warrant of arrest for Ajay Gupta for
charges that are not related to the dairy farm case, however.
