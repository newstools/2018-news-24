Christina Pitt Cape Town - Odourless brown water was seen pouring into Three Anchor Bay in Cape Town on Friday, but it seems the City of Cape Town was not aware of it. However, once authorities were alerted, ward councillor Shayne Ramsay consulted marine biologist Gregg Oelofse. "That will be a burst water line somewhere in the broader catchment area," relayed Ramsay. Ramsay could not say when the burst would be repaired, but said she would deal with the leak personally. "I have reported it and I am going down there to see for myself if it is still pouring out in such volumes," she said.   Odourless brown water pouring into Three Anchor Bay.
