Cape Town - The world awaited the resignation of Jacob Zuma as president and when he did international media was quick to break the news. The New York Times described him as “a master tactician who survived a string of scandals“ while BBC notes that he leaves “with several scandals hanging over him”. Zuma’s legacy, in most international media, is one “mired in corruption scandal” and not much reference to his struggle credentials. Reuters briefly mentions Zuma’s struggle credentials, his four wives and that he has “a sharp tongue”.
