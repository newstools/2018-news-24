Byrone Athman PETER John Dick pleaded guilty to running a brothel on Prince Alfred Street after being arrested in September 2015. The two-year long case was heard in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court on Monday when Dick was fined R250 000 without having to face any jail time. In September 2015, the South African Police Service (SAPS) embarked on an operation to close down brothels in the city. The police operation was a success and it yielded excellent results, bringing down 15 brothels that were operating in the city. Cluster Commander General Makoba applauded the work of Lieutenant-Colonel Maharaj and his team for the effort they put into seeing Dick arrested and seeing the case through, commending them on a job well done. Spokesperson for the SAPS, Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese, said that the success of the case helped the police in many ways. “We are thankful that we succeeded in getting a guilty verdict out of him because it helps prevent other opportunistic criminals and this leads to a cleaner city.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
