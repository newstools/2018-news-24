The doctors, in a statement, said the 54-year-old monarch had felt the symptoms on January 20. "Radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmia," or irregular rhythm, had successfully normalised his heart beat. King Mohammed, who would resume his normal activities after a period of rest prescribed by his doctors, has ruled Morocco since the death of his father Hassan in July 1999. He underwent an eye operation in the French capital last September. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
