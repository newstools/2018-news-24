Grandmother Kae Skinner Sera uploaded the tear-jerking video on Facebook of her grandson Riley and his fellow choir mates performing in the British capital. “Cape Town friends – tonight my grandson Riley was one of 7800 children singing Africa at the O2 in London,” Kae wrote. “Rain will be coming your way if these kids have anything to do with it. My eyes are watering already #proudgranny.” According to SA People, Kae didn’t attend the show but her daughter sent her the video. The clip video has been shared more than 1 000 times and has racked up more than 45 000 views on social media. “I hope the rain will come to your beautiful place,” said one user. “Oh wow the tears are falling as a mom with grandchildren in London this is even more special,” said another. The grandmother, who was born in Scotland but now lives in Cape Town, says she’s been touched by the amazing response the video has received “We are all totally overwhelmed. I do hope it makes a difference."  Additional source: sapeople.com 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
