Warrant Officer Wynita Kleinsmith says a residence in Keith Road, Ottery was searched and police found a large quantity of dagga on the premises. Four suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested and will appear in court on charges relating to dealing in and possession of drugs. Station commander, Lieutenant Colonel Christian Esau, says police will focus on crime by being heavily dependent on police action and presence. Fuad Titus, chairperson of the Grassy Park Community Policing Forum (CPF), says: “We congratulate the police on the find and wish to thank the community for reporting drugs in the area. It is important that our community continues to identify places of ill repute so that police can act. “The removal of narcotic substances from our community will certainly stifle the illicit trade and save lives.” He adds that the Grassy Park CPF will continue to be vigilant and promote cooperation between police and the community, and he calls on community organisations, faith-based institutions, schools, crèches and sports clubs to join the local policing sector forum where issues of crime are discussed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
