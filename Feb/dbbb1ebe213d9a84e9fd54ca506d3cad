Diego Novella testified that, while Alban was suffering from Lyme disease in 2014, he was "her only emotional support". "She didn't want to see her friends," he added. He said he was her only shoulder to cry on. "Literally, her condition affected me directly." Prosecutor Mornay Julius quoted Novella's feelings toward Alban from the notes compiled by psychiatrist, Dr Claudia de Klerk during cross-examination. "She made my life hell whenever we were together," read Julius. Read: Murder accused Diego Novella admits to infidelity "She was not appreciative of anything I did for her." Novella confirmed during cross-examination that he may have said something of that nature to De Klerk. "Gabriela was a very demanding person and her problems from the US involving her taxes frustrated her a lot," he said. He also told forensic psychologist Tania Swart that, when they visited South Africa, she was "the same...as critical as ever", according to evidence Julius presented. In court, Novella could not confirm that those were his words. "What I desired more than anything, was for Gabriela to get better," he said. He made it clear that he could also recall the good times he had experienced with Alban. Novella is accused of murdering Alban at an upmarket Camps Bay hotel on July 29, 2015. The trial is to resume on Tuesday, February 27. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
