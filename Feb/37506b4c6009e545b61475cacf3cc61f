In the video, a man wearing a blue shirt can be seen bending down and slipping his cell phone between the feet of the woman who is standing in front of him. He appears to be taking a photo or video on his phone. Sensing something is amiss, the woman turns around and catches the man in the act, who then pretends to be busy with something else on the floor. According to the Zululand Observer, the woman, who is intent on pressing charges, was reportedly turned away from Richards Bay Police Station when attempting to open a case. The video has had over 300 shares on Facebook and many labelling the man a ‘sicko’. “This guy tied his invisible shoelaces!” read one comment. “Why block his face? Find out who this guy in Richards Bay is and charge him accordingly. He deserves to be punished,” said another. King Cetshwayo SAPS Cluster communications officer, Captain Mbongeni Mdlalose, says police are aware of the incident and are currently investigating. The woman’s claim she was turned away by police is also being investigated, he added.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
