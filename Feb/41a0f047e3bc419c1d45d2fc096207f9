No group has claimed the responsibility for the attack. However, Somalia's government has blamed the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab for the bombing on a crowded street. Security officials said the bomb weighed between 589kg and 771kg, further indication that the extremist group's bomb-making capabilities have been growing. The attack appalled Somalis, with some calling it their "9/11." Only a handful of attacks since 9/11 have killed more people. Thousands of Mogadishu residents later marched in defiance against the extremist group, while the president announced a new military offensive. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
