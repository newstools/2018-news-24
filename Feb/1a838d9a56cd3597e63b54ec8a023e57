This is not something we alleged. The paragraph he quotes from in our critique actually reads as follows: "A second argument [about why education quality is poor] is that there is too little money within the State and that officials are therefore unable to provide access to better quality schools. But this argument also falls apart. South Africa’s per capita spending on education and its spending as a share of GDP is competitive with emerging markets that outperform it on education benchmarks year after year." It is clear, and has been our position for years, that we do not regard resource constraints as an explanation for the poor quality of schooling. We would encourage readers of the MEC's response to our critique to carefully scrutinise each of his specific answers against each of our specific concerns.
