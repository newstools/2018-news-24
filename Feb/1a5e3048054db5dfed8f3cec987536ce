Interior Ministry spokesperson Mwenda Njoka said on Wednesday that Miguna Miguna renounced his Kenyan citizenship years back, becoming a Canadian citizen, and had never reclaimed Kenyan citizenship. Rights activists and opposition supporters have demanded the freedom of Miguna, who had been in detention despite court orders on Friday and Monday for his release. Police said they charged Miguna in a court outside the capital, Nairobi.
