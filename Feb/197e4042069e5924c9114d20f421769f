Musa Ecweru, a government minister in charge of refugees, says in a statement that an investigation is under way after the United Nations resident coordinator raised concerns last month. Ecweru says the allegations of "gross mismanagement, fraud and corruption" include theft of relief items for refugees. It is not clear how many resources were allegedly diverted. The allegations threaten Uganda's reputation as a progressive host for refugees fleeing violence in neighbouring countries. Uganda has struggled to support more than 1 million South Sudanese refugees, many of whom poured in over the past year and a half.
