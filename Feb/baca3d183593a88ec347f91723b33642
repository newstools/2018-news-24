with us immediately,” was the impassioned Facebook post from a young Cape Town
woman on Thursday evening. Nicola’s mom, Gill Packham (57), from Constantia, has been missing since 7 am on
Thursday. She was last seen in her BMW when she was on her way to the
Springfield Convent School in Wynberg where she was working, a notice from the
Pink Ladies reads. Pink Ladies is a non-profit organisation that helps to find
missing people. Meanwhile, another woman was found in the boot of a burned
BMW at the Diep River train station last night, said Col. Ander Traut
spokesperson for Western Cape police. The police are aware of Gill's disappearance after a
relative opened a case at the Diep River police station, but says it's too soon
to deduce that Gill is the woman in the boot. "Both cases are currently being investigated by the
police," said André. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
