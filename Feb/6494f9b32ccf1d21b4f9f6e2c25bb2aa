The drought and associated water shortage have officially escalated to the level of a disaster. Water in the dams supplying Nelson Mandela Bay will last only a few months. The hope is on a natural solution - rain! Therefore a special interdenominational prayer service for rain will be held  tomorrow and all interested are invited  to attend the gathering on Uitenhage Market Square in front of the Town Hall at 13:00. It is organised by the Uitenhage Ministers Fraternal and the duration of the service is only 45 minutes. “The service is being held to pray for much needed rain in the Eastern Cape, as well as the Western Cape. Both provinces are facing a crisis of catastrophic proportions unless good rains fall within the next few weeks,” said pastor Ken du Pisanie from Philadelphia Church and a member of the Uitenhage Ministers Fraternal. “This call goes to members from all churches and residents from Uitenhage as well as Despatch and surrounding areas to gather and unite and to humble themselves in calling on the Lord to have mercy on the land and give us rain,” said Pastor Du Pisanie. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
