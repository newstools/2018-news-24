He was found guilty after the magistrate heard how he repeatedly raped his biological daughter in 2013, according to police. "In February 2013, the victim (13) was at her father's homestead at Matshana area, Empangeni, when she was called by her father to his bedroom," said police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala. "She was raped by her father and she reported the matter to her stepmother, who was not at home on that day." The local police were contacted and a case of rape was opened at Empangeni police station. Thereafter, the docket was transferred to the Empangeni family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit for further investigation. The investigation led to the arrest of the accused who was subsequently charged with rape, according to a statement. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the sentence handed down to the accused. "The accused was expected to look after his child and protect her against being abused by criminals, but instead, he raped her," he said. "This will serve as a stern warning to would-be criminals who intentionally abuse young children." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
