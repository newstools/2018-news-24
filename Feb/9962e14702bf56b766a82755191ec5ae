The state-run MENA agency quoted an unnamed security official on Wednesday as saying the farmland in the Nile Delta province of Beheira belongs to Abdel-Monaem Abul Fetouh. Abul Fetouh was arrested last week, after his return from a trip to London. He was ordered detained for two weeks pending completion of an investigation. He was a longtime Brotherhood member, but quit the group in 2011 to run for president in the 2012 election won by President Mohamed Morsi.
