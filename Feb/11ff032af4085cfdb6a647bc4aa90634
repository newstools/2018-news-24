Research conducted by Medirite Pharmacies concludes that more South Africans die from heart disease daily, that one in three adults suffer from high blood pressure and that ten people suffer a stroke every hour. Free wellness screenings have been performed since 7 February on senior citizens aged 60 years and older, as well as on the first Wednesday of every month. The check-ups test blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index (BMI). Pensioners can make an appointment at a local Medirite Pharmacy, producing their green ID book when doing so. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
