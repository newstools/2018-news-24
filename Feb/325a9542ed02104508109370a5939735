Executive Vice President and Chief Compliance Counsel George Sorial says in a statement that the donation was made on February 22 and includes profits from January 20 through Decemer 31, 2017. The company declined to provide a sum or breakdown. The US Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sorial says the company has made good on an ethics pledge to donate foreign government profits during Donald Trump's presidency. The watchdog group Public Citizen has questioned the spirit of the pledge because the methodology used would not require any donation from unprofitable properties receiving foreign government revenue.
