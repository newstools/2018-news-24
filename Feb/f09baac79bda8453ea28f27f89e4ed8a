                    bottom ANC condemns assault outside Luthuli House The African National Congress condemns in the strongest possible terms the assault of protesters by a grouping outside the ANC headquarters, Chief Albert Luthuli House, earlier today. Regardless of what some may deem as provocation by the Black First Land First Movement who intended to march to Luthuli House, there will never be any justification for scenes as the ones witnessed today. Disturbing in the extreme is the assault of women in so callous and dehumanising manner. The ANC calls upon on law enforcement agencies to act without fear or favor to bring the perpetrators to book. Should these perpetrator be found to be members of the ANC, the relevant structures, must without any delay, institute disciplinary proceedings against them. ANC Joburg strongly condemns acts of violence by Thabiso Setona The African National Congress Greater Johannesburg Region has noted with dismay and utter disgust the images and videos circulating of Thabiso Setona, ANC Branch Secretary in Inner City, Zone 12, assaulting a woman outside Luthuli House this afternoon. As the ANC in Joburg we strongly condemn any acts of violence against any person, more so women. The ANC Greater Joburg does not subscribe to the notion of people violently assaulting those who hold contrasting political views. Thabiso Setona’s acts do not represent what the African National Congress stands for, and as a consequence of his revolting behavior, he will face a disciplinary process hastily. #ANC supporters are now starting to leave #LuthuliHouse. @ #LuthuliHouse BLF member to Magashule says we love you leadership, seconds later members of his own political party boo him...
