The five would-be-robbers arrested regarding a botched robbery at a farm near Reitz remain in custody. The suspects are Lebohang Mokoena, Pule Moloi, Mkhulu Sebatana, Tankiso Mofokeng (all South Africans) and Masitifa Makawana (from Malawi). They reappeared in the Reitz Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday (14/02), facing charges of attempted house robbery, illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. Capt. Zweli Mohobeleli, police cluster spokesperson, says they are suspected of attacking a domestic worker at a farm in the Reitz district on 8 February. “Three of the five men allegedly threatened her with a firearm and thereafter tied her up in the house. As they proceeded searching for valuables in the house, the alarm was triggered. “They fled the house empty-handed and went to hide in the bushes,” says Mohobeleli. He says the three were arrested within the vicinity following an intensive search by the neighbouring farmers and the police. Mohobeleli says the other two suspects were busted a day after the botched robbery while the vehicle used was recovered and confiscated. “The police found a firearm used during the failed armed robbery in possession of the fifth suspect.” The suspects are expected back in court later this month. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
