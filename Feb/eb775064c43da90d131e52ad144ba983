The film ruffled feathers in some parts of the country, resulting in a suspension of screenings at two cinemas in the Eastern Cape. Traditional leaders in the Eastern Cape protested against the screening of the film, saying that it had inaccurately portrayed the Xhosa initiation tradition and flouted cultural norms and practices. The CRL Commission recently found that the film was "blasphemous to the sacred rituals of initiation" and said the use of Jesus Christ and King Shaka Zulu "poses a concern in our young democracy and the film may incite violence".It had received a complaint from amaXhosa King Zwelonke Sigcawu, with a memorandum from Contralesa and the Man and Boy Foundation.
