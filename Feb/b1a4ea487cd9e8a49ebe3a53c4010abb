CEO Kallie Kriel in a statement said it was of "utmost importance that ministers who are linked to state capture were fired, and also that those who were unfit for their positions were removed from Cabinet". "This will make a new start possible," he said. He was, however, unhappy about the "contentious" David Mabuza's appointment as the country's deputy president, as well as the decision to include former social development minister Bathabile Dlamini in the new Cabinet. "AfriForum will keep a close eye on the new Cabinet members to ensure that they are accountable and will not also plunder the State coffers as their predecessors had done," Kriel said.
