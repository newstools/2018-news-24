More than 600 delegates participated in the congress at the Olive Convention Centre, said Philisiwe Sefatsa, DA's provincial communications manager in a statement. "This is the first step towards bringing about a new beginning for the people of KZN," she said. She said the DA has demonstrated its strength in the province by "constantly marking its footprint across the province". The DA said the 2016 local government elections proved that their growth was not limited to the urban area. "The DA has set its sight on bringing the ANC below 50% in 2019, and the party will unite and work together towards achieving this." The new provincial leadership is: Provincial leader: Zwakele Mncwango Provincial deputy leader: Mergan Chetty Provincial chair: Francois Rodgers Provincial deputy chairpersons: Hlengiwe Shozi, Craig Millar and Shehana Kajee 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
