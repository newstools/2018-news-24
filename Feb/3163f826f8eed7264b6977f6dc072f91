In a statement issued on Sunday the diplomats said Odinga needs to accept Kenyatta is president "as the basis for the dialogue that it and many Kenyans want." Opposition leader Raila Odinga held a mock inauguration last week in which he was sworn in as the "people's president." The government reacted by shutting down some broadcasters and arresting some participants. Odinga charges he was cheated of victory in the August election by hackers who altered the vote.
