Cape Town Central police are looking for help in solving two rape cases. In the first incident, officers are requesting help in identifying a suspect who allegedly raped a 26-year-old woman on Friday 10 March last year. The woman and a friend were at Shwarme Caf√© in Short Market Street when they met two coloured men, who introduced themselves as Ricardo and Lorenzo. The two men offered to drive the woman home, as they claimed to also live in Kuils River, like the woman. However, once in the car, the men drove to a secluded location where they raped her. Police also need assistance in a second, unrelated crime incident, in which a 20-year-old woman was robbed and raped on Friday 15 September last year. The woman was walking along Bree Street after leaving a club at around 20:00. She was approached by a group of men who robbed her of her silver bracelet and took turns raping her on the pavement in a dark alley. V
