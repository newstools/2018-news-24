Over the past few weeks, the school has encouraged its pupils to bring water from home to assist with the initiative and pupils responded well. The handover was held at the school last Friday. Organiser Kelly Peyper said the initiative was done in conjunction with the Ramsgate Lions Club and the results were better than expected. “I did a similar project two years ago for Vryheid and I still had my Gift of the Givers contact from then. So I contacted them and asked if we could do this. One of our other teachers, Mrs Kirkley, is a member of the Ramsgate Lions Club so they also joined in and collected bottles from their shop at Hibiscus Mall in Margate,” said Peyper. She said the pupils were all excited to participate and also received a certificate of appreciation for their efforts. “The staff and pupils of Port Shepstone Junior Primary have shown great initiative and their kindness is truly appreciated,” said Imraan Mahomed from Gift of the Givers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
