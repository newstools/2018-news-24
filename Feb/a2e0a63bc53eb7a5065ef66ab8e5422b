While the announcement at a press conference provided South Africa with some much-needed clarity on the matter, the timeline around Zuma's resignation deadline was left up in the air. Secretary general Ace Magashule said Zuma had not been given a timeline to step down, but added that he was "sure Zuma will respond tomorrow (Wednesday)".
