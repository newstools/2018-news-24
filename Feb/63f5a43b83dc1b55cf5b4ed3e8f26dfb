Imagine if Zuma did not engage in all these corrupt shenanigans what an inspirational success story his would have been. An uneducated young Zulu man who fought in the liberation of our people rises to become the President of SA. Very sad that power corrupts.#ZumaResigns Can we please just not have a president for a moment? We need some space as a country. #ZumaResigns#ZumaPresser pic.twitter.com/pDlLmkA1B6 What a loss to South African entertainment industry ????#ZumaResigns #SABCnews Let's wait for Mark Fish to post a picture of Thabo Mbeki, thanking him for his service #ZumaResigns pic.twitter.com/UQA3ivcqEX He resigned and my heart skipped a beat!!! His speech has touched me, hamba kahle msholozi! Even though we wanted this; we must admit a level of shock and disbelief. He respected the ANC's decision, one could even sense him being emotional.
