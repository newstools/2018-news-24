Zuma said the ANC has not provided him with reasons why he should resign as the president of the country. "I need to be furnished on what I have done. Unfortunately, no one has been able to provide what is it that I have done. I said to them, if I have done something wrong, there are processes in the ANC," he said. It is still unclear whether President Zuma will resign. He says he will issue a statement later today. The ANC has released a statement saying that they "will await delivery of this response by President Zuma".

He isn’t thinking in a particularly lucid manner.I suspect he has alienated a lot of his friends and allies with this rambling interview. #ZumaSpeaks / #ZumaResponds was cringeworthy & embarrassing! #ZumaSpeaks#ZumaRespondsShort sum up of his long speech in one pic pic.twitter.com/rs16cWPd43 I think this what we need to do as a country to get rid of Msholozi???? #Anc #Zuma #ZumaResponds #ZumaSpeaks pic.twitter.com/xwXy6A4fs7 Zuma is acting like that drunk Uncle who won’t leave your house after a family gathering #ZumaResponds I think uncle Cyril also owes us a fireside chat now. ?? #ZumaResponds pic.twitter.com/dbum7S3Y2O I asked what is irritating Baba’s throat and my colleagues say The Truth! ?????????? #ZumaResponds #ZumaResponds Says this interview has been helpful. Yes, it has helped us understand his extent of his narcism and his delusional mentality. Be very careful of a man willing to drag the whole party down simply because he doesn't want to step down. If Zuma cared about the ANC, he would've resigned peacefully to pull a front of "unity" .
