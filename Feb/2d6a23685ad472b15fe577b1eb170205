Zuma said the ANC has not provided him with reasons why he should resign as the president of the country. "I need to be furnished on what I have done. Unfortunately, no one has been able to provide what is it that I have done. I said to them, if I have done something wrong, there are processes in the ANC," he said. It is still unclear whether President Zuma will resign. He says he will issue a statement later today. The ANC has released a statement saying that they "will await delivery of this response by President Zuma".
