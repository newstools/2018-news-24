The 26-year-old woman was arrested along with a 24-year-old man on Thursday night. They cannot be identified until they appear in court on Monday on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. READ: Cop stabbed to death in front of his children Their arrest follows the arrest of Nemugumoni's daughter, 21-year-old Mphophi Nemugumoni and a 19-year-old man, Calvin, Tshisudi, who later appeared in the Vuwani Magistrate's Court. The case against them was postponed. Mojapelo said that the 24-year-old man and Tshisudi were "known to be notorious criminals and are likely to be connected to other crimes in the area". Earlier this week, Mojapelo said the policeman was attacked by an unknown man with a sharp object on Monday night, just before 23:00, when he arrived at his house. "[His] children were alerted by frantic screams and peeped through the window and were shocked to see the suspect butchering their father," he said at the time. The alleged killer fled the scene after the children screamed for help, Mojapelo said, and Nemugumoni was declared dead on the scene. He was based at the Levubu police station. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
