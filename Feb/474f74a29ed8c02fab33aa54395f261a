We are wondering if it was the ADF who have turned up in Goma, because this is the way they killed people in Beni." Government forces last month launched an offensive in Beni against the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), one of a number of armed groups that hold territory in the eastern DRC and are battling for control of the region's rich mineral resources. Beni lies about 250km north of Goma. Congolese authorities and the UN mission in DRC, MONUSCO, accuse the ADF of killing more than 700 civilians as well as combatants in the Beni region since 2014. The group is also blamed for the killing of 14 UN peacekeepers last month, the biggest single such loss in 25 years. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
