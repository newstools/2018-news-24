The handover took place at the school on January 25. This is the second donation of its kind that ALPLA has made since 2016, where Nsimbini Full Service School in KwaZulu-Natal was the first beneficiary. The donation is in excess of R260 000 and consists of 40 tablet PCs, a teacher’s laptop and an offline content server with full educational suite, subjects, books, apps and more. The brITe box, as the mobile trolley is called, is the only battery-powered trolley of its kind and is designed to empower Joe Slovo’s 1 276 learners in every subject, including mathematics, science, literacy and computer programming. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
