The army said the civilians were returning from a village market on Friday afternoon when their vehicle hit a land mine between Kontza and Dera in the West African nation's central region. This attack on civilians comes weeks after 26 people, including women and children, were killed after their vehicle hit a land mine near the border with Burkina Faso on the way to a market in Mali. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attacks, although al-Qaeda-linked jihadist groups regularly lay mines targeting Malian soldiers. Islamic militants also stormed an army camp on January 27 in northern Mali, killing at least 14 soldiers. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
