Daniel Ranti Masenya, 36, was found guilty on six counts of rape and sentenced to an effective 21 years in jail on Monday. Limpopo police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the crimes were committed between 2009 and 2014 around the Sebayeng area, in the Mankweng policing precinct, east of Polokwane. Ngoepe said provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba welcomed the sentencing and "commended everyone who participated in these investigations" for their "meticulous work". The victims, aged between 22 and 47, were all attacked in their homes as they slept. "The accused, who used to cover his face with a bandage and armed with a panga, would allegedly break a window to gain entrance and once inside, threatened his victims and continued with his dubious deeds," Ngoepe said. "In some instances, he would rape them in the presence of their children." Ngoepe said Masenya was also linked to another incident in 2013 where he attacked a 22-year-old woman in the bushes while she was collecting firewood for her mother. He also allegedly attacked two of his victims while wearing only a T-shirt, armed with a panga and with his face covered with a bandage. "This reign of terror was finally put to a stop in 2015 when a dedicated task team from the Polokwane family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit managed to crack the case and successfully linked him with all these cases," Ngoepe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
