According to NewsDay, Parirenyatwa said the move would also save on foreign currency. Parirenyatwa said this while speaking during the launch of the Zimbabwe Private Sector HIV and Aids and Wellness (ZIPSHAW) co-ordinating board in the capital Harare. The minister urged private companies "to come on board in the fight against HIV and start manufacturing drugs together with condoms, which are suitable for the Zimbabwean people". He said that young people in the southern African country complained about the size of the imported condoms, saying that they were "too small".
