The SOPA was supposed to be delivered on Friday. However, after Jacob Zuma resigned as president and Cyril Ramaphosa was elected his successor, the State of the Nation Address ended up being moved to Friday. Zille's SOPA was therefore postponed. On Thursday the Western Cape Provincial Parliament announced online that the State of the Province Address would be held next Thursday, February 22, at 14:15. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
