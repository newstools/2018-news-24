GREATER Edendale Mall, in partnership with Liberty NPO, is celebrating the second annual World Wetland Day at the mall. This year’s focus is on raising awareness about the importance of wetlands for people and the planet. This year’s theme, “Wetlands for a Sustainable Urban Future”, highlights the importance of wetlands in contributing to making cities liveable. The ongoing growth of human settlements in today’s world is a major concern for wetland conservation. As cities grow and the demand for land increases, the tendency is to encroach on wetlands. They are often viewed as waste land, to be used to dump waste on, or be used for other purposes, but when preserved and used sustainably, urban wetlands can provide multiple economic, social and cultural benefits for surrounding communities and cities. A total of 360 pupils and 14 environmental stakeholders will be getting together on World Wetlands Day on February 2 at Greater Edendale Mall to share and engage in caring for our wetlands. Over 40 wetlands are recorded in the Greater Edendale area, with only one being fully functional. Greater Edendale Mall has seized this opportunity to educate the Edendale community about our wetland and those in their immediate vicinities. Schools attending the event are either built on a wetland or within the immediate vicinity of one. “As a mall, we are committed to making our cities liveable by taking action today to retain, restore and preserve urban wetlands,” said marketing manager at Edendale Mall, Sonya Caldecott.     — Supplied 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
