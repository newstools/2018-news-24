His error follows another blunder in January, when he announced that IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had died instead of former Bophuthatswana leader Lucas Manyane Mangope.

The SABC had spoken to Ndoro, who indicated that he was fatigued and needed rest. "Management has agreed to his request and he will be taking a break from the show. Ndoro has apologised to the president and his apology has been accepted," Kganyago said. Tsvangirai, 65, founded the opposition party, the MDC in 1999, and was well known as one of Zimbabwean ex-president Robert Mugabe's critics. Tsvangirai died on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
