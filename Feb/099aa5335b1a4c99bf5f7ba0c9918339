After Zuma announced he was stepping down as South Africa’s leader on Wednesday, the governor of Imo State in southeastern Nigeria, Rochas Okorocha, came under pressure to remove the life-size statue of Zuma that was installed in Owerri, the state capital, by the government. The governor had spent about $1.3 million (R15.1 million) to build the statue, which was unveiled to mark Zuma’s controversial visit to the area in October. An outraged public had criticised government for wasting public funds when workers in the state, including judges, were still owed salaries for up to six months of work at the time. On Friday, in reaction to public pressure to dismantle Zuma’s statue after his fall from power, the Imo State government said: “He [Zuma] resigned honourably. He came to Imo to partner with the Rochas Foundation College of Africa. He didn’t come for politics. And even after his departure as president, he would still go ahead to make his contributions to the education of the less-privileged children in Africa.” It is doubtful that the statue, one of seven cobbled together by Okorocha in defiance of public opinion, will survive beyond his final term in office next year. The governor, a member of the governing All Progressives Congress in Nigeria, has been severely criticised for running the state like a family cult.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
