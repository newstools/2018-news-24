Sportsmen and women are deeply empathetic to the plight of those with life-threatening blood disorders as they appreciate the fact that they can enjoy outdoor sport. “Leukaemia patients often spend weeks or months in isolation wards and sport is not an option for them,” said Allison Ekstrand, public relations and events specialist for The Sunflower Fund DBN. Miles4Hope participants are equipped with the tools to assist them in effectively approaching their personal and work databases to sponsor them financially per mile or kilometre covered,with no contribution being too small. All funds raised from the campaign will enable The Sunflower Fund to create awareness as well as educate and recruit more blood stem-cell donors to offer the hope of life to patients in need of a life-saving transplant. Any person or club interested in joining the Miles4Hope 2018 campaign can contact Allison Ekstrand at 031 266 1148 or e-mail allison@sunflowerfund.org.za The Sunflower Fund regional office has limited charity bonds availability for the 2018 Cape Town Cycle Tour for KZN participants at R1 500 per cyclist, kit not included.
