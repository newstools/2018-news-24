Murder-accused Henri van Breda is facing closing arguments in the Western Cape High Court.  Jump to
                    bottom Jansen interviewed family, friends and "key figures with insight"." They
 paint a picture of parents who had been perplexed with their difficult 
'loner' child," said Jansen, adding that Henri's drug addiction 
apparently led to "great discord" in the house and he was apparently 
angry at his parents who favoured his brother, Rudi, over him. Journalist Julian Jansen was one of the first journalists on
the scene and has been covering the case for Rapport. His book, The De Zalze Murders, "tells the story behind
the newspaper headlines", offering insights that have not yet been
publicly heard and highlighting the human side of the tragedy. "The Van Bredas of Stellenbosch were apparently the
perfect family - rich, successful and popular. In the luxurious De Zalze estate
they have a dream life. And then everything changes in an instant," he
said. On his final day in the witness stand, neurologist Dr James Butler 
said it was possible that Van Breda had committed the murders before 
suffering an epileptic seizure, which could explain why there was a 
two-hour-and-40-minute lapse before he phoned emergency services. During
 cross-examination, Butler agreed that it was more probable that the 
possibly self-inflicted injuries would have occurred after the murders, 
but before the seizure and postictal state (recovery period after a 
seizure). Marli van Breda asks not to be made available to brother's defence team, court hears Marli van Breda has indicated to the State that she would not want to be
