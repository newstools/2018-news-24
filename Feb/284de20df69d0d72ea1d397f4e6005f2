It was led by the police in the Northern Cape’s Firearm, Liquor and Second-Hands Goods (Flash) unit, in conjunction with Eskom, Telkom and Transnet. The delegation reportedly included experts of different departments, who assisted in identifying goods possibly belonging to them. According to Capt. Sergio Kock, police spokesperson, the focus was mostly placed on the illegal possession of copper cables, railway material, tower batteries and solar panels. The operation had reportedly been triggered by the sentencing of Fanie Isaacs (38) by the Northern Cape High Court in 2017 for the theft of earthing cables from Transnet locomotives. He was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment. Kock said the stolen cables had an estimated value of approximately R1 million. The team issued a stern warning about the purchasing and selling of stolen goods, and informed the dealers of the approval of the new Criminal Matters Amendment Act of 2017, which makes provision for sentences of over ten years for the theft of critical infrastructure. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
