Use the presidency to right the wrongs of Marikana #SONADebate EFF leader @Julius_S_Malema while Mcebisi Skwatsha speaks: "Are you taking notes, honourable President? We're choosing ministers now." Ramaphosa laughs, Skwatsha says it is a low blow #SONAdebate (@gerbjan) #Hill-Lewis: Summits, conferences and dialogues are not sufficient to give hope to the unemployed youth #SONADebate #Meshoe: We welcome your commitment to ensure ethical behaviour and ethical leadership #SONADebate #Meshoe: On Wednesday we want a new minister of Finance to deliver the budget #SONADebate EFF's @MbuyiseniNdlozi commends Bathabile Dlamini for her "great conduct" in the house. "Thanks to the conference for  humbling her." She seems less than impressed. #SoNADebate @TeamNews24 #Khawula: We now need a good team around you, a team with good integrity #SONADebate Lekato's speech was interrupted by frequent "point of orders", which mostly came from the EFF, who differed with him on the land question. Lekota asked: Whose land are you going to take? But Ndlozi stood on a point of order, asking Lekota why did he go to Robben Island if he doesn't believe in land expropriation without compensation. #Lekota: If you are going to take the land, you must clarify who is our people and who is not our who will benefit from the land #SONADebate Lekota: "Who are not our people?" ANC MP's: "YOU!" #SoNADebate @TeamNews24 EFF MPs interrupt Lekota, and they get a bit personal, and an argument ensues over the land issue. Lekota complains that they're eating into his time. The stand-in speaker attempts to restore some order.  Everybody laughs while Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota complaims that too much of his time has beem taken. Bigger laughs when he refer to Ramaphosa as deputy president #SONAdebate @TeamNews24 Mbhele wraps up and makes way for COPE leader Lekota, who starts off by congratulating Ramaphosa (under his breath) for his "elevation" to the position of president... ANC MPs interject on a point of order and say they cannot hear Lekota clearly.  Mbhele: "Where your government does fall short, we will point out, as is our duty as the opposition."  #SONADebate Mbhele says the DA wants Ramaphosa to impress on the police minister to establish a board for the police who will tackle the issues facing the police ministry. Mbhele addresses the worrying shortcomings of the South African Police Service.  #Mbhele: We welcome the commitment to ensure resources are directed to the police station level #SONADebate Mafu wraps up and makes way for the DA's Mbhele, up next.  #Mafu Sithumeni, asibuyi mva, sibheka phambili, siphicula iimpilo zenu kwaye sisebenzisana nani #SONADebate Jump to
