                    bottom Lekato's speech was interrupted by frequent "point of orders", which mostly came from the EFF, who differed with him on the land question. Lekota asked: Whose land are you going to take? But Ndlozi stood on a point of order, asking Lekota why did he go to Robben Island if he doesn't believe in land expropriation without compensation. EFF MPs interrupt Lekota, and they get a bit personal, and an argument ensues over the land issue. Lekota complains that they're eating into his time. The stand-in speaker attempts to restore some order.  Mbhele wraps up and makes way for COPE leader Lekota, who starts off by congratulating Ramaphosa (under his breath) for his "elevation" to the position of president... ANC MPs interject on a point of order and say they cannot hear Lekota clearly.  Mbhele: "Where your government does fall short, we will point out, as is our duty as the opposition."  Mbhele addresses the worrying shortcomings of the South African Police Service.  Mafu wraps up and makes way for the DA's Mbhele, up next.  Jump to
