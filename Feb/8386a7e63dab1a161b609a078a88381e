conducting forensic tests to establish whether the body of a woman found in a
burnt-out car in Diep River, Cape Town, is that of a missing Constantia woman. Family members
of Gill Packham (57) reported her missing on Thursday afternoon at the Diep
River police station. She was last seen leaving her home early on Thursday
morning in her green BMW. She’d been on her way to Springfield Convent School,
where she works in the office. The family
is very upset and keeping to themselves, a friend of the family told YOU. “They are
all tight-lipped and do not want to say anything. I haven’t even seen them
since it all happened.” On Thursday
evening police were called to the scene of a burning BMW at the Diep River
train station. “The burnt
body of an unidentified female was found in the boot of the vehicle,” police
spokesman Lt-Col André Traut says. “Both matters are being investigated by
police and it’s too soon to make an assumption or to link the disappearance of
Mrs Packham to the burning vehicle. “We’re
awaiting feedback from forensics in terms of the post mortem reports.
 Detectives are also reviewing video footage and other possible evidence.” According
to news website Netwerk24 a middle-aged man dressed in blue
shorts is connected to the burnt-out car in Diep River. One of
Gill’s daughters, Nicola, has also since removed the heartbreaking Facebook post in which she pleads with people to
help look for her “precious mom”. No arrests
have been made.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
