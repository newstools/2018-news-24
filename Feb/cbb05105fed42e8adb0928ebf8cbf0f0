Ekurhuleni East Cluster spokesperson Captain Thivhulawi Tshilate said the police were investigating a business robbery and murder case. Tshilate said a blue Toyota Corolla Professional and a grey Audi A4 with registration number FPV 579 MP, allegedly arrived at the Engen garage in Selcourt, pretending to fill up with petrol. When the petrol attendant went to pay at the cashier, a firearm was pointed at him. Four petrol attendants and a customer with a small child were forced into the kitchen and placed under guard, he said. The suspects then bombed the drop-in safe and took undisclosed amount of money and cigarettes, said Tshilate. "While the robbery was on progress, an EMPD motor vehicle entered the garage with two members to buy an airtime voucher. Suspects started shooting at the EMPD members. "The driver sustained multiple gunshots and was certified dead on the scene. The female colleague escaped unharmed. The firearm of the EMPD member was also taken." Tshilate said an estimated eight suspects sped off in two motor vehicles. The police are appealing to the public to contact the SAPS Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS 32211 if they have information that could lead to a successful prosecution.
