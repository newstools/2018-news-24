The death of Samantha Pendo (Swahili for love) shocked this country although it has become used to acts of police violence, including killings of suspects captured on video with no repercussions on the officers. At least 92 people, the majority of them opposition supporters, have died in clashes with police in protests against Kenyatta's victories in elections in August and October. Kenya's Supreme Court nullified Kenyatta's win in August citing irregularities and illegalities and ordered a fresh election on October 26 which the opposition candidate Raila Odinga boycotted, citing inadequate electoral reforms. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
