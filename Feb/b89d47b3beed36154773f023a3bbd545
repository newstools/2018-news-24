This is after technicians and staff rushed to the pump station last Friday morning after receiving information that it had been vandalised, leading to a water stoppage in the surrounding areas. Upon arrival, it was established that the vandalism happend about six kilometres from the plant, where members of the community allegedly excavated below the surface and tampered with two valves feeding the system. The road leading to the pump station had been blocked with rocks, which had to be removed by the technicians in order to repair the system. Allegations are that this is a result of unrest in the community of KwaGoqoza, possibly linked to unemployment issues. Chiliza said acts of vandalism lead to financial loss and are disruptive to the process of improving water supply. Areas that are supplied by the Umthavuna reservoir that were affected include Port Edward, Southbroom, KwaXolo, Ezinqoleni and KwaNzimakwe. In a statement on the Ugu Facebook page, Ugu denied that it was due to community unrest, unlike previous similar incidents in KwaGoqoza, which were addressed by Ugu councillors. Ugu said technicians worked around the clock to restore supply in the affected areas. Acts of vandalism lead to financial loss and are disruptive toimproving water supply. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
