Officers launched a manhunt after three armed men broke into a home in the early hours of January 28 and abducted a 13-year-old girl and a 1-year-old baby. "The men took two children from different rooms and vanished into the darkness," said police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi. The two girls were living with their 50-year-old grandmother and her 18-year-old daughter at the time of their abduction. When the two tried to intervene "they were met with the barrel of a gun". "No arrests have been made, but the police are working with the community to find the two girls," Hlathi told News24. There is speculation that Gabasile Simphiwe Shabani, 13, was abducted because of her albinism. The suspects may have assumed that the 1-year-old Nkosikhona Welcom Ngwenya has a similar condition. "Nothing else was taken from the house except the two children whose whereabouts still remain unknown," added Hlathi. Police have opened cases of housebreaking and kidnapping for investigation. Anyone with information that may assist in locating the children and their abductors must contact SAPS Crime Stop at 08600 10111. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
