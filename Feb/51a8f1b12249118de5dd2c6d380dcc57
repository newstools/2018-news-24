The first incident occurred while the bus was travelling on the N2, near Mthatha on Sunday afternoon and the bus driver had to swerve suddenly for a stray animal in the middle of the road, Department of Health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said. In the process, the bus tipped over and landed on its side.
