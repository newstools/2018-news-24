According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Mohadi denied that there was a witch-hunt against perceived President Emmerson Mnangagwa's enemies. The report said that Mohadi's remarks came after the Movement for Democratic Change's general secretary Douglas Mwonzora alleged that the arrests and prosecution of former finance minister Ignatius Chombo, ex-Zanu-PF youth leader Kudzanai Chipanga as well as Innocent Hamandishe were "seemingly selective application of the law".

Reports indicated that several of Grace Mugabe allies, who included Chombo, the ex-local government minister Saviour Kasukuwere, former foreign affairs minister, Walter Mzembi, energy minister, Samuel Undenge and former education minister Jonathan Moyo were facing corruption probes. It also emerged that Mnangagwa's government was probing the former first lady’s sons over gold trading. But, according to Mohadi, the government was serious about combating graft and it was targeting everyone who was a criminal and corrupt. "It doesn't work that way. We are targeting everyone who is a criminal and corrupt and those who are claiming that we are only targeting a certain group of individuals are talking nonsense and their claims are baseless and unfounded. We have courts where the issue of guilt or innocent will be proven," Mohadi was quoted as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
