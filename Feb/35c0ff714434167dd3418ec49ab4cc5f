According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Masvingo provincial chairperson, Ezra Chadzamira, said that the party would take tough actions against anyone found contravening President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s directive of having free and fair elections. Zimbabwe was set to hold its elections before the end of July after President Emmerson Mnangagwa recently pointed to an earlier date than expected following the ousting of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe. Mnangagwa, 75, took office in November after a shock military takeover ended Mugabe's 37-year reign. He vowed to hold fair elections to ensure Zimbabwe "engages the world as a qualified democratic state", signalling a break from Mugabe's era. Speaking to party supporters in Bikitha, Chadzamira said there "would be no sacred cows" when dealing with perpetrators of violence. "Our leader president Mnangagwa has been making clarion calls for peaceful elections. The president has strongly stated that there is no room for political violence here in Zimbabwe and has even highlighted that message at various international fora that the new government condemns all forms of violence as the nation braces for elections. I am happy that president Mnangagwa has been loud and clear that perpetrators of political violence will be dealt with without fear or favour, there will be no sacred cows," Chadzamira was quoted as saying.
