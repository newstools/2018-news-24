Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Tsvangirai's spokesperson Luke Tamborinyoka said in a statement the former union chief had appointed Nelson Chamisa, 40, as acting president "until the president's return."

Local media reported this week that his condition had deteriorated in recent days but the 65-year-old Tsvangirai refuted the claims in a post on twitter saying he was shocked to read that he was critically ill. "Of course I have cancer and not feeling too well but I am stable and the process is under control," Tsvangirai said in a post on twitter, adding that "I am recovering." Internecine feuding over Tsvangirai's success is threatening to tear the party apart ahead of crucial general elections in which new president Emmerson Mnangagwa has vowed a clean sweep. Tsvangirai has led the MDC since its formation in 1999 and the party has posed the most formidable challenge to the ruling Zanu-PF party. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
