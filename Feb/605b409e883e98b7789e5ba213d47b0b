new South African president everyone seems to be talking about who they think
he should remove from the cabinet. In a recent article on News24
columnist Adriaan Basson listed the minister of police, Fikile Mbalula, as one
of those who should go. Seemingly aware of an upcoming cabinet reshuffle the
outspoken Mr FearFokkol, as he refers to himself on Twitter, urged the new president
to make his decision while also mentioning that he opposed Jacob Zuma in the
elective conference last year. “I opposed President Zuma in Mangaung he didn't reshuffle
ME, Dont ask me Why? Cde President Ramaphosa must choose his team and move on. We
need to focus on winning the election,” Mbalula posted on Twitter. Twitter users found this funny, with many saying they
believe president Ramaphosa should remove Mbalula as the minister of police. Check some of the reactions to the post below:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
