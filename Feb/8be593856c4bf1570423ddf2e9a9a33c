The guard, believed to be in his 30s, was shot by one of four occupants of a silver Mercedes Benz, who had robbed a man of cash at gunpoint in Grey Street, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane told News24. Zwane said the suspects abandoned their vehicle when security guards, who witnessed the incident, chased after them. "The municipal security guards that were in the vicinity gave chase and the suspects abandoned their vehicle. Another security guard saw the fleeing suspects and attempted to intercept them. The suspects allegedly shot him [in] the right upper chest and he died at the scene," said Zwane. Rescue Care paramedics spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said they arrived at the scene after 12:00 and found that the security guard had gunshot wounds to his upper body. "He was assessed by paramedics, however, there was nothing more they could do for him and he was declared [dead] on the scene," he said. Zwane said investigations conducted at the scene of the crime revealed that the vehicle had been hijacked in Chatsworth this month. "A case of murder is being investigated by Durban Central police," he said. There have been no arrests. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
