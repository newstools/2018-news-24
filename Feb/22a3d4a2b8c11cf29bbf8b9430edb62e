Staff Reporter The Hillsong Church will host their first sisterhood event of 2018 in 11 locations such as Century City, Somerset West, Mitchells Plain, Gugulethu, Stellenbosch, Southern Suburbs, Macassar, Centurion Pretoria, Gauteng and at Pollsmoor Prison on Saturday 3rd March. Those in Gugulethu can pop in at NY 77 Tembaletu School in Gugulethu 10.30am for 11am. Admission is free for these events and a kid’s programme will also be available. SISTERHOOD seeks to “gather, equip and mobilize” women of all age, background and culture in the belief that together we can and will make the world a better place. Off the back of this event we gather annually for our biggest women’s conference, Colour. It is happening on the 11th-14th April in South Africa with 10 000 women gathering over 2 conferences at the Grand West arena in Cape Town. It’s an everlasting love story of placing value and belief upon the feminine heart. COLOUR is about you and your world. It is humanitarian at its core and our desire as 21st century women.
