Gautrain spokesperson Kesagee Nayager said the 4-car train was stranded before Midrand station, on its way back from Hatfield at the end of service. Nayager said the maintenance rail-road vehicle was used to tow the 4-car train back to the depot. "The train was not in service at the time and thus no passengers were on-board," Nayager said. Netcare911 spokesperson Nick Dollman said two other men sustained minor to moderate injuries. They were transported to hospital. "A full investigation is underway to determine the root cause of the incident and we will fully collaborate with the Railway Safety Regulator to conduct its independent investigation," Nayager said. No further delays linked to this incident are expected.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
