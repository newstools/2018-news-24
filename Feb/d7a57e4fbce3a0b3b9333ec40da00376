The Antiquities Ministry said on Tuesday the head and chest of the statue of Ramses II were found in the Temple of Kom Ombo during a project to protect the site from groundwater. Egypt hopes the find, along with other recent discoveries, will help revive its tourism sector, which has been battered by years of unrest since the 2011 uprising. Ramses II, also known as Ramses the Great, ruled Egypt from 1279 B.C. to 1213 BC. He is credited with expanding Egypt's reach as far as modern Syria to the east and Sudan to the south.
