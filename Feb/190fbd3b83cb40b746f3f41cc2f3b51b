This happened after a meeting between Zuma and the ANC's new top six leaders on Sunday night at the presidential guesthouse in Pretoria. The NWC meets every second Monday and was only scheduled to meet again next Monday, February 12. EFF leader Julius Malema tweeted after Sunday night's meeting:  The top ANC leaders entered Zuma's residence shortly before 20:00 and left around 22:00. At last Monday's meeting of the NWC, the committee told the top six to ask Zuma to leave and asked for feedback after their meeting with Zuma.
