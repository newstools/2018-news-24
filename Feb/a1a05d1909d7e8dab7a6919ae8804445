The threat came a day after the United States, France, Britain and four other UN Security Council members called on Kabila to publicly declare that he will not run for election this year. Washington separately asked Kinshasa to scrap plans to use electronic voting for the first time in elections this year, saying it risked undermining the credibility of the historic polls. "These elections must be held by paper ballot so there is no question by the Congolese people about the result," said US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley.

Kabila, 46, who has ruled for 17 years has not yet clearly stated whether he will step aside. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
