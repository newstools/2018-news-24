                    bottom When pork was moved during Dempers' experiment, the knife dislodged. Pork skin thicker than human, small layer of fat, not as pliable. Knife would not have remained lodged in #VanBreda's body if there had been a fight, Adv Galloway says. Dr Butler conceded that he couldn't determine which part of 2h40m was seizure and what was postictal state, Adv Galloway says. Could strategise and reason, make decisions. He said it was possible he was malingering, she argues. #VanBreda Rudi #VanBreda would - according to pathologist Dr Anthony's testimony - not be able to move from the bed to the floor, Adv Galloway says. #VanBreda does not have blood on bottom of his socks. His fingerprints not on axe, Adv Galloway says. No evidence of any contamination, Adv Galloway says. #VanBreda Finances involved in accreditation, and Lt Col Otto said she was unable to answer why SAPS lab not accredited, Adv Galloway says. Explained it was not a legal requirement. #VanBreda Regarding possible intruder: Blood drop on door didn't contain human DNA. Blood on boundary wall more likely spatter from #VanBreda boys' room, as per Captain Joubert. Found no corresponding drip trail outside the house. Does not support version of attacker fleeing the house. Security guard Wyngaard did not drive past 12 Goske Street and was not as close as neighbour Op't Hof was that night, Adv Galloway says.  #VanBreda Aspects listed as not in dispute are not agreed on - it is not known Martin worked at dining room table; when Henri smoked 3 cigarettes; was dressed in underwear when questioned by police...   #VanBreda Adv Galloway says security guards who testified didn't know of anything suspicious that night, both via control room and other residents.  #VanBreda Adv Galloway replies.Dip in power caused the activation of the De Zalze's alarm that night. #VanBreda Incorrect that #VanBreda and Rudi's blood was found in shower, Adv Botha says. It was presumably of blood, and contained DNA material of Rudi and his client. Adv Botha says there is not enough information surrounding the axe mark on the stairs to exclude the reasonable possibility of #VanBreda throwing the axe at a fleeing attacker. Judge Desai says with assaults of this magnitude, wouldn't you expect some injuries to be inflicted onto the perpetrator? #VanBreda Judge Desai says with assaults of this magnitude, wouldn't you expect some injuries to be inflicted onto the perpetrator? #VanBreda If proven not all wounds were self-inflicted, leaves the question - who stabbed his client, Adv Botha asks. #VanBreda Adv Botha says Dempers and Tiemensma conceded that determining if injuries self-inflicted is most difficult tasks for a physician. Points out they had to refer to photos. #VanBreda Adv Botha asks whose version is more probable - the State's or #VanBreda's? Judge Desai says #VanBreda made rational decisions that morning when speaking on the phone with emergency services. Dr Butler testified malingering could be excluded, Adv Botha says. #VanBreda Judge Desai says Botha's version suggests someone came to 'soek 'n gelukkie', goes upstairs without taking anything, commits unprecedented mass murder. What are the probabilities? #VanBreda Desai says in this situation, 4 people in #VanBreda house. No one creates a scene, shouts. Botha says Rudi is asleep, Henri shouts and father comes in room, he can't recall mother's reaction. If Henri attacker, why would it make it less likely for them to shout for help? Desai: What is likelihood someone enters premises, finds a house... what are the probabilities? Botha says if someone comes with intent to steal, finds house easy to enter, look through cupboards while another goes upstairs, finds Rudi asleep. Wakes up; starts attack. #VanBreda Adv Botha says as one comes up stairs, boys' room is first. This is where the first attack happened. Nothing about #VanBreda's version that necessitates that assailant needed to know layout of the house. Adv Botha says it's easy to enter the property. Perimeter fence alarm was triggered at 01:37 and 03:36. Could have been caused by unauthorised entries or exits. Judge Desai says security officer inspected entire fence next day and found nothing wrong. #VanBreda Adv Botha says WO Oliphant conceded identifiable fingerprints were lifted at scene that could not be linked to any family members, #VanBreda, or any of those who were at the house after the murders. Crisp question for court to decide is whether the State produced evidence which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that there were no unknown assailants present in the house during the attack, Adv Botha says.  #VanBreda Jump to
