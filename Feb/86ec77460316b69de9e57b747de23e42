                    bottom Regarding possible intruder: Blood drop on door didn't contain human DNA. Blood on boundary wall more likely spatter from #VanBreda boys' room, as per Captain Joubert. Found no corresponding drip trail outside the house. Does not support version of attacker fleeing the house. Judge Desai says with assaults of this magnitude, wouldn't you expect some injuries to be inflicted onto the perpetrator? #VanBreda Judge Desai says #VanBreda made rational decisions that morning when speaking on the phone with emergency services. Dr Butler testified malingering could be excluded, Adv Botha says. #VanBreda Judge Desai says Botha's version suggests someone came to 'soek 'n gelukkie', goes upstairs without taking anything, commits unprecedented mass murder. What are the probabilities? #VanBreda Desai says in this situation, 4 people in #VanBreda house. No one creates a scene, shouts. Botha says Rudi is asleep, Henri shouts and father comes in room, he can't recall mother's reaction. If Henri attacker, why would it make it less likely for them to shout for help? Desai: What is likelihood someone enters premises, finds a house... what are the probabilities? Botha says if someone comes with intent to steal, finds house easy to enter, look through cupboards while another goes upstairs, finds Rudi asleep. Wakes up; starts attack. #VanBreda Adv Botha says as one comes up stairs, boys' room is first. This is where the first attack happened. Nothing about #VanBreda's version that necessitates that assailant needed to know layout of the house. Adv Botha says it's easy to enter the property. Perimeter fence alarm was triggered at 01:37 and 03:36. Could have been caused by unauthorised entries or exits. Judge Desai says security officer inspected entire fence next day and found nothing wrong. #VanBreda Adv Botha says WO Oliphant conceded identifiable fingerprints were lifted at scene that could not be linked to any family members, #VanBreda, or any of those who were at the house after the murders. Crisp question for court to decide is whether the State produced evidence which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that there were no unknown assailants present in the house during the attack, Adv Botha says.  #VanBreda Jump to
