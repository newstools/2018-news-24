"All I can say for now is that I am free," Tarkint mayor Baba Ould Cheikh told AFP by telephone. "I'm at home now." A relative confirmed the release, telling AFP he had seen Cheikh earlier in the day, adding that his abduction by six gunmen sometime between January 21 and 23 had been due to "a private matter". A security source said at the time that the abduction was carried out either "by people he had a disagreement with, or Islamists". Mali's government signed a peace agreement with coalitions of non-jihadist armed groups in the north in June 2015. But Islamist insurgents remain active, and large tracts of the former French colony are lawless. The mayor had been named in an enquiry into a drug-smuggling operation in 2009 involving a Boeing 727 flown from Venezuela and burnt after unloading the cargo in the northern Gao region, according to the UN drugs agency.
