doe-eyed baby girl is desperate to talk in the videos, her mom says – and for
the first time since her unfortunate accident it seems she’s also keen to flash
a little smile. Baby Mienke,
who recently celebrated her first birthday, was rushed to hospital after she choked
on her milk while in the care of her day mother in Mbombela (Nelspruit), in
Mpumalanga, in August last year. Last month
her parents, Ryno and Verna Mulder, told YOU they were hopeful Mienke would
smile again soon – and in this video indeed it seems a smile has crept into her
eyes and the corners of her mouth are turning upward. “It’s not
yet a full smile but I think that’s not far off,” Verna told YOU.com. The Mulders
attribute Mienke’s progress in recent weeks to the platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
treatment she’s been receiving. Verna
explains it involves her daughter’s blood being taken and the platelets
separated in a centrifuge. Afterwards the platelets are returned to her body
via IV. It’s hoped
the platelets will repair damaged tissues. This treatment has now been
completed but Verna is due also to donate stem cells to her daughter so the
little girl can start stem cell treatment. “I’m
donating to her but it’s quite a process, so Mienke will start the treatment
only about two months from now,” she says. “We’re
seeing progress. She wants to talk and she makes small sounds. Before she would
make sounds only when not happy but now she’s really trying,” Verna adds. Verna and
Ryno earlier told YOU they were hoping and praying Mienke would make a full
recovery despite doctors not being optimistic about her prognosis.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
