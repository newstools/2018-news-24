Gauteng legislature spokesperson Fezile Nondonga said: "The GPL deeply regrets any inconveniences caused and will inform you once a decision has been taken regarding the new date." Nondonga was not immediately available for further comment. The decision comes a week after Parliament's presiding officers announced that the State of the Nation Address, which had been set down for February 8, had been postponed indefinitely amid fears that it might descend into chaos. Other events that have been postponed until further notice include the 2018 annual Ubuntu awards, which Zuma was set to officiate at the weekend. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
