The apparent syndicate allegedly received bribes ranging from R5 000 to R10 000 in exchange for issuing licences without the mandatory test, said Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso. The examiners, four driving school owners and three driving school instructors were arrested by the Hawks' serious commercial crimes investigation unit on Monday. "The group was rounded up in Potchefstroom and Mogwase," Rikhotso said. She said their arrests formed part of a project-driven investigation which started in 2017 aimed at addressing fraudulent and corrupt activities at traffic stations and driving schools in and around the North West province. "This followed various reports about driving school owners allegedly colluding with examiners at testing stations to issue learners and drivers licences to undeserved applicants in exchange for a bribe," she said. The suspects, aged between 29 and 66, were expected to appear before the Potchefstroom and Mogwase Magistrates courts on Tuesday facing charges of fraud and corruption. They had not appeared in court at the time News24 contacted Rikhotso at about 15:00. Provincial head of the Hawks Major General Linda Mbana congratulated the investigating team "that ensured that corrupt traffic examiners and driving school owners are brought to book". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
