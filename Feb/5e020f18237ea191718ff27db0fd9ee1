The blast - which was not immediately claimed by any group - wounded two others at a checkpoint on the road leading to Tripoli, some 500km to the north, said commander Ahmed al-Mesmari. Jihadists from the Islamic State group remain active in central and southern Libya despite being forced out of their northern stronghold Sirte in 2016. Libya has been gripped by chaos since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011, with rival administrations and multiple militias vying for control of the oil-rich country. Haftar supports an administration based in the east of the country. A UN-backed unity government based in the capital Tripoli has struggled to assert its authority outside the west.
