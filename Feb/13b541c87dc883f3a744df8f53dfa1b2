Pupils who are teasing or making fun of other pupils must be punished. Schools shouldn’t tolerate bad behaviour. They must be dealt with harshly so that pupils who think of behaving badly think twice. Constant teasing can contribute to the development of mental health issues such as depression or anxiety. Many children are able to overcome teasing while others can be left with long-lasting emotional scars. The scars can affect present behaviour as well as increase the risk of psychological and academic hardships throughout school and into adulthood. A common reason why a kid is a bully is if he or she lacks attention from a parent at home. Other kids bully because they learn this behaviour at home. Parents need to monitor their children’s behaviour at all times. They need to learn to handle conflict well and teach their children good behaviour and manners. They should be involved in their children’s lives to see if their children are being bullied or if they are bullying other kids. Pupils who misbehave are every teacher’s nightmare and since corporal punishment was banned in our schools, disruptive behaviour has become a big problem. It’s unacceptable for pupils to behave in a manner that makes it hard for other pupils to learn in the classroom. Pupils must know how to behave and it is the responsibility of their parents to teach them. Teachers cannot be expected to do everything. They already have a big job to do and that is to educate our children. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
