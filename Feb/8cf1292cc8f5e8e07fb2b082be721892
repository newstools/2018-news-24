The pupils, in full school uniform, demanded that the teacher be reinstated with immediate effect. It was not clear when and why the teacher was dismissed from the school. News24 contacted the school, but a teacher who answered the phone said that the principal was not there. "Speak to the district office," he said, adding that the pupils had decided on their own that they would march. When News24 called Ilembe district manager Nkosana Mzoneli for comment, he ended the call and cut later calls. He did not respond to a text either. KZN MEC for Education Mthandeni Dlungwana's spokesperson Kwazi Mthethwa, condemned the pupils' march. "While we appreciate and respect their views with regards to how they think their school should be run, we don't wish to see learners engage themselves in activities that have a potential to disrupt the process of teaching and learning. "We have a unit called Human Resources Management, which deals specifically with issues relating to employment of our teachers and their conduct," he said. Mthethwa said they are treating the matter with urgency. "We're going to ensure that, whenever there's a gap for whatever reason, we close that particular gap with the urgency it deserves. The department is committed to providing quality education to all learners in the province," he said. The pupils marched from Chief Albert Luthuli and King Shaka streets while on their way to the district offices. KZN police said no incidents were reported during the march. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
