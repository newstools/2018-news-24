Florida - The world's most powerful rocket, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy, blasted off 
on Tuesday on its highly anticipated maiden test flight, carrying CEO Elon 
Musk's cherry red Tesla roadster to an orbit near Mars. Screams and cheers erupted at Cape Canaveral, Florida as the massive 
rocket fired its 27 engines and rumbled into the blue sky over the same 
NASA launchpad that served as a base for the US missions to moon four 
decades ago.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
