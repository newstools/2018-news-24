KWADUKUZA architectural student Vianka Chetty (23) is one of the only students in her field of study to have been awarded the Erasmus Scholarship to further her studies in architecture at the University of Valladolid in Spain. Chetty, who recently graduated with a Diploma in Architectural Draughting as well as a Diploma in Architectural Technology, is currently studying towards her Bachelor’s Degree in Architecture at the Durban University of Technology (DUT). She was notified about the scholarship and applied for it via DUT. It was good symbols in every subject that landed Chetty the incredible learning opportunity abroad. The Erasmus Scholarship Programme is a nationwide European programme that seeks exchange students and provides them with the opportunity of receiving higher education at leading universities across Europe. The programme pays for the student’s flights, accommodation, and education, and also gives them the added advantage of learning Spanish whilst studying at Valladolid. “I’m very excited about this learning opportunity as it will open so many doors for me in my career. I’m excited to visit new places, learn a new language and to make new friends. I would like to thank my parents, Nandha and Sumi Chetty for all their support. I promise to continue to excel in my studies whilst I’m oversees and make you proud,” she said. Chetty leaves for Spain today (January 31) and will return in mid-July. - Supplied by Selina Chetty
