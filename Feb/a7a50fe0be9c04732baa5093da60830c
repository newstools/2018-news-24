Speaking to DRUM, Mboro said he was currently in Durban and after what happened there, he believes that praying for rain would solve of all Cape Town’s water problems. “It’s amazing. I am in Durban to pray for rain in Cape Town,” he said. “After my meeting with a great leader, honourable Prince Buthelezi, God showered us with blessings of the rain,” he continued. According to Mboro, it was hot when he arrived at the beach but after he prayed for rain, it immediately started to rain. Mboro also told Sowetan that his church, Incredible Happenings Ministries would also be praying for rain in the Eastern and Northern Cape provinces since they are also prone to droughts. The prayer will resume on Sunday and carry on for the next 90 days to prevent the taps from running dry on Day Zero. It is not the first time that the pastor had relied on praying for rain as a drought solution, in 2016 a rain prayer-service was  been held in his church in Katlehong after Water and sanitation minister, Nomvula Mokonyane warned that the lack of rain would lead to a drought. Thousands flocked to the prayer service including celebrities and politicians.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
