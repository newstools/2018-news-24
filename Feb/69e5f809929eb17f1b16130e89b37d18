Tammy Petersen Cape Town – Four people have been arrested for public violence as a housing protest in Gugulethu continued on Monday after a land invasion attempt. Main roads in the area were strewn with bricks and traffic lights were vandalised as locals demanded land for adequate housing. On Monday morning, the N2 was temporarily closed because of the protest action. On Sunday, a supermarket was looted and a car was set alight. Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said public order police members were monitoring a group of about 100 protesters along NY6. "Meanwhile tyres are still burning on the road. The protest that left several businesses and vehicles torched started [on Sunday] in NY108," he said. "Earlier in the day they occupied a vacant piece of land in the area. Four suspects were subsequently arrested for public violence. They are expected to appear in court soon." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
