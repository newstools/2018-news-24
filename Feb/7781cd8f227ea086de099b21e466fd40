Simaney Kido was absent when her case was called, and the State confirmed that no arrangement was made to explain her absence. Her advocate was also not present. But, she arrived at court a short while later, saying that the trains caused her to arrive at court late. Kido, along with Christopher September, Larry Johnson, Taswill Kriel, Morné May and Mirriam Johnson are accused of killing Woodward in Ocean View in December 2016. The six-month-old was hit by a stray bullet while on her father's arm, outside their home. Her father had reached for her dummy, which she spat out, when the bullet hit her in the head. Her father was also shot in the thigh, but still managed to drive his daughter to hospital. - Read: Dad rushed dying Zahnia to hospital while bleeding from own gunshot wound Her mother had returned from work and had just gotten out of a taxi when she heard that her baby had been hit.
