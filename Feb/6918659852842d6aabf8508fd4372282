The authorities under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi have cracked down on some artists in Egypt using wide-ranging morality laws. Shyma, a little-known 21-year-old Egyptian, was sentenced to two years in prison in December over a racy music video clip. She was arrested after appearing in a video showing her in a mock classroom licking an apple and appearing to mimic fellation on a banana in front of a chalkboard scrawled with "Class#69".
