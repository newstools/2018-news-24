Spokesperson James Wellsted said power had been restored, rescue operations had begun and the first lift had brought up a group of miners. Wellsted told EWN that they will continue to hoist the remaining miners till everyone is out of the mine. The miners will be taken to the change house where they will be able to shower and get food before having medical assessments. Trauma counselling has been provided for them and their families, he added.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
