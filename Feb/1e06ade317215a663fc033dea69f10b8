FORMER Cosatu secretary-general Zwelinzima Vavi is one of the men who made Jacob Zuma president but now has deep regrets for his serious error of judgment. He never for a moment suspected that Zuma would change like a chameleon and take them all for a ride. But Vavi jumped off as soon as he noticed Zuma was not the people’s hero but the kingpin in the Gupta state-capture scandal. I like the crocodile imagery he used in his interview on eNCA. He said that Zuma is like a man trying to wade through a crocodile-infested river. Four hungry crocodiles are waiting hungrily to snap their jaws at Zuma. The first one is the ANC faction. If he manages to escape the jaws of the ANC faction, then the NPA is waiting to charge him with 783 charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering. If he eludes the gaping jaws of the NPA, then a third, even bigger crocodile is ready and waiting to tear him apart. This would be Parliament’s vote of no confidence where ANC MPs may turn their backs on him and join forces with the opposition to get him out. If, however, he manages to escape yet again, then the fiercest and most deadly man-eating crocodile of them all is waiting to swallow him: impeachment. It is very unlikely that Zuma will evade all four crocodiles and reach the safety of the other bank. He is bound to be devoured by one or more of them. It’s not that there would be much sympathy for him, but for the good of the country and himself, it would be wiser for him to walk away now and retreat to the safety of his Nkandla den with his ill-gotten gains than enter the crocodile-infested water.
