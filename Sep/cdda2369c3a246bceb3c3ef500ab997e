It was alleged that the two worked together to issue fraudulent learner's and driver's licences between 2014 and 2017, Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo Mnisi said. "The driving school owner would recruit clients on weekends, outside of operating hours, and bring them to the local traffic department and illegally issue them with learner's and driver's licences in exchange [for] bribes," Mnisi said. The arrests were made during a joint operation involving the Hawks' Serious Corruption Investigating Unit, Local Criminal Record Centre and Tactical Response Team, she added. Evidence was also confiscated during the operation. The two are expected to appear in the Prieska Magistrate's Court on Friday, Mnisi added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
