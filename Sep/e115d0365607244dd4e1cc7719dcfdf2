According to police reports, the 35-year-old from Hammarsdale approached his first victim while the boy was on his way to a local store. “The suspect was driving a marked company vehicle when he asked the boy for directions to the Roman Catholic church,” explains KZN SAPS spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. She says the boy reportedly got into the truck with the man but he drove past the church. “The suspect drove past and stopped in a deserted area where he allegedly raped the boy,” Colonel Mbele told Drum. The alleged rapist reportedly drove the little boy back to where he’d been picked up after the alleged incident. The suspect then allegedly went to a house in the area where he found two children playing. “He took a six-year-old girl and raped her too,” Colonel Mbele alleges. A case of rape was opened at the Inchanga Police Station and both victims described the same man to the police. “Investigations led the police to a company in Hammarsdale where they found a lead on the man who was driving the company vehicle,” reveals Colonel Thembeka. The suspect was subsequently apprehended on Friday morning and will appear at the Pinetown Magistrate Court on Tuesday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
