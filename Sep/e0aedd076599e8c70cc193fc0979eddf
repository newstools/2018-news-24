This dancing doctor brings joy to his patients’
hospital rooms! Hospitals have never been a fun place,
especially for children, but pediatric
neurosurgery physician assistant Tony Adkins (42) from California, US, knows
the best medicine for any patient is
laughter. In an attempt to cheer up his patients
before surgery Tony, who works at the Children’s Hospital of Orange Country
(CHOC), has earned himself the nickname “Dancing Doc”, reports Metro. Since the hospital has uploaded videos of
Tony and his patients jamming to various songs on their Facebook
page, Dancing Doc has become a viral sensation. The much-loved doctor says he boogies for
his patients in hopes that he’ll protect
the “magic of childhood” regardless of their diagnoses. “Dancing with patients is important because
it adds levity and joy to the hospital experiences,” Tony said. "What I'm doing is right in [line] with
CHOC's commitment to preserving the magic of childhood and ensuring patients
don’t have to put their childhood on pause. “Studies show when people laugh, smile and
become more interactive, the effect on the brain is more powerful than some
pain medications.” In an interview with Good Morning America,
Tony spoke about how dancing has changed his patients outlook on their stay in
hospital. Tony Adkins, CHOC Children's dancing neurosurgery physician assistant, shared his passion for patient care and dance on #gmaday at @goodmorningamerica studios this morning! We're so grateful to Tony, and all of our wonderful clinicians, who help us ensure that CHOC patients don't miss out on opportunities for fun. ????The link to Tony's awesome interview is in our bio. Tap to watch, but — fair warning — it’s going to make you want to dance! A post shared by  CHOC Children's ?????? (@chocchildrens) on Sep 12, 2018 at 12:36pm PDT  "If I can instil a love of music and
dance in my patients, in addition to improving their outcomes and outlooks,
that’s a wonderful thing,” he continues. "There’s nothing better than seeing a
smile on my patient’s faces or to hearing them laugh – it’s self-care for me
too." Watch
