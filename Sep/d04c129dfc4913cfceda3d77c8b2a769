As the mangled bodies of the pair – who had known the groom since their school years – were pulled from the wreckage, the wedding rings were collected by another wedding guest so the service could go ahead. The men – named only as Mateusz and Bartek, both 24-years-old – were reportedly rushing to be at the church on time and had overtaken another car when the tragic incident happened in Grebow, a village in south-eastern Poland. It’s reported that Mateusz was driving but lost control of the vehicle after the manoeuvre. The car hit a concrete sign and then smashed into a tree. It’s believed they were killed instantly. The incident is still under investigation says Piotr Walkowicz from the prosecutor’s office in Stalowa Wola. “We don’t know yet why the driver came off the side of the road during the overtaking manoeuvre.” Other drivers called emergency services and police, but it was too late. Investigating officers say there was no chance of the pair being rescued. Walkowicz says the incident was horrific. “The car was scrap metal. And the men’s injuries were simply unimaginable. I still have the picture in my mind.” Local media said that another wedding guest was at the scene to pick up the rings and the nuptials went ahead. Tributes have since been paid to the pair who died. “They were the most positive, kind and nice people you can imagine. I can’t even mourn them both, it’s surreal for me that they’re even gone,” said an unnamed teacher from the high school both men had attended. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
