SHOPLIFTERS have taken to a new trend of bringing in their children when they are going to shops with an intention of stealing. The respondent for medical emergencies at the South African Community Crime Watch, Alan Cutten, said that it’s not just a trend that is happening in far away places but that it has already taken place twice in one of the centres in the Upper Highway. “Shoplifters now bring their children with when they are going to shops with an intention of stealing. “They think that if they are with their children the security guards will be lenient with them when they are found out to have stolen from the shop,” he explained. “The shops now need to be aware of this new trend which is going around,” he warned. SACCW founder Steven King, confirmed this new trend and urged shops to be more cautious with these types of criminal offences.
