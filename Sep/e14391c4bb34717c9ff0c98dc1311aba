vehicle is in motion has gone viral on social media.  The 19-year-old learner is allegedly a pupil
at Oosterland High School in Secunda, Mpumalanga. In the clip – posted by education department spokesperson
Elijah Mhlanga – the learner verbally abuses the driver before grabbing and
punching him in the head. Other learners in the bus are heard screaming, asking
the driver to stop the bus. “The violence is shocking,” Mhlanga wrote in the post’s
caption.  Speaking to DRUM, Mhlanga says the pupil has been suspended
from school and that the incident is being investigated. “This is a pending
case and charges of assault have been pressed against the learner.” Spokesperson for the department of community safety and transport,
Joseph Mabuza, tells DRUM he has seen the video but has not been informed about
the details of the case yet. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
