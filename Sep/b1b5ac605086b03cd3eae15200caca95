Dian “Didi” Terblanche (18) had to be taken to the operating theatre every 48 hours to clean and treat his wounds, the Hero Burn Foundation’s Facebook page reports. The organisation supports burn victims and their families. A representative of Hero Burn says Dian and his father, Dieter, had been trying to put out a fire on their farm near Reitz when the wind changed direction and Dian was engulfed in flames. Dieter had suffered a burn wound to his arm in the incident. “Dian’s right arm had to be amputated due to the seriousness of the sounds,” the representative told YOU. The organisation posted a picture of a healthy Dian on its Facebook page and captioned it, “RIP beautiful #HeroDidi #HeroDian.” The caption continues, “#Didi you will be missed . . . .you will always be loved by so many . . . We ask that everyone keep on praying for Didi’s parents, brothers, grandparents, rest of the family and friends. Our deepest condolences. We grieve with you.” Dian’s mother, Riana, is too distraught to talk about her family’s loss. Her Facebook page has been inundated with messages of support and condolences. “May your family be strengthened in this time. May He comfort and support you in this difficult time. You’re in our prayers. Much love,” one friend of the family wrote. “May Jesus pick you up and hold you close,” another friend wrote.  Yet another wrote, “I’m keeping Didi safe in my heart. Rest softly in Jesus’ arms.” Dieter’s Facebook page is similarly populated by messages.  Dian leaves behind his parents, grandparents and two brothers, TJ and Paul. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
