Iavan Pijoos Western Cape police have arrested a 30-year-old man who was driving around in a hijacked vehicle in Crawford, Cape Town, on Monday afternoon. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Traut said the police's flying squad identified the car while on patrol, and then blocked the man's getaway route on Kromboom Road. In an attempt to escape from the police, the man crashed into another vehicle and overturned the car. Pictures circulated on social media of the car on its side in Kromboom Road while the arrested suspect lay on the ground. Traut said the BMW was hijacked in the suburb of Diepriver last month. The suspect is expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court soon.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
