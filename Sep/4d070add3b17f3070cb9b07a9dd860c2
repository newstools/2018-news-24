Brady was given 10 years' imprisonment for fraud, wholly suspended for five years on condition that she not commit fraud or theft during that period, as well as two years' correctional supervision by the Bellville Specialised Commercial Crime Court. She also received a R10 000 fine for contravening the Public Finance Management Act. She was convicted of acting contrary to tendering process and acting outside the scope of her duties when she purported to represent the Western Cape housing department. She entered into an agreement with Lelethu Properties and Development, a construction company, to build low-cost houses in the Blue Downs area of the Western Cape. News24 previously reported that the State alleged that Brady made oral misrepresentations to Lelethu's Faizel Davids in September 2006. Brady allegedly provided Davids with a document in December 2006 that looked like a letter of appointment, dated December 22, 2006. Part of the letter said: "... it is further confirmed that I, Wilma Brady, chairperson: Oostenberg subcouncil 21, on behalf of the provincial housing department, appointed Lelethu Properties and Development to develop the serviced land as set out above". She was convicted in July and had been out on warning pending her sentencing.
