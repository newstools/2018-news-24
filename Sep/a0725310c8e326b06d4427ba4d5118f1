The fashion fundraiser is the very first of its kind in the Bay, and the event will consist of a combination of fashion, entertainment, cars, food and crafts, all with a vintage twist. Established by Gary and Deirdre Jones in 2011 after the birth of their second daughter Hope in 2008, The Hope Jones Foundation is aimed at enabling and empowering children with physical and mental disabilities in Nelson Mandela Bay. The NMU students teamed up with the foundation as part of their year long Public Relations project, in which they were tasked to team up with a local NGO to help fulfil their various needs as their PR practitioners. The line up of the event includes performances from the NMU ballroom and latin dance society, a string of stalls, ranging from food, coffees and other refreshments, jewellery, cosmetic, craft and clothing exhibitors. Come along and browse, you may just find that gift or item of clothing you have been looking for. There will also be plenty of photo opportunities during the event, and one can snap a selfie with the beautiful vintage cars. All photos taken at the event will be published on our events official page after the event for viewing. Prizes will also be awarded for the best dressed couple and individuals as well as many other prizes to be won. All proceeds raised will go to the Hope Jones Foundation.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
