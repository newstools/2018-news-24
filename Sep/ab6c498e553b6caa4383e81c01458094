In an affidavit, deposed in Dubai and stamped by the commissioner of oaths at the South African consulate in Dubai, Gupta says that he made no offer of a ministerial position to Jonas, as was alleged by the former deputy finance minister to both the public protector and the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture. He also denied offering Jonas money to accept the position. "I did not have any knowledge of any upcoming cabinet reshuffling and/or about ministers that may be fired and I did not have any influence over the appointment of any members of the national executive nor did I ever have such influence," he says.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
