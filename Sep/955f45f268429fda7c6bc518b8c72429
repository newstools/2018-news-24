Fever Reporter THE community of Kokstad has threatened to picket outside the Kokstad Magistrate’s Court today, September 21, when a 26-year-old man from Bhongweni will appear for two counts of murder, stating that they do not want the man to be granted bail. The accused was arrested for allegedly killing Siyanda Mkhize (24) and Teboho Mafali (30), who both worked at a bakery in Kokstad. It is alleged that, on September 2, they were approached by the man who stabbed Mafali twice on the right thigh at the Bhongweni area. Mafali was taken by his friends to EG and Usher Memorial Hospital and died the following day. The body of Mkhize was discovered on September 3 by a passerby who alerted the police. “There was blood around his body, with signs of [him] being stabbed, and a wallet next to his body. He was taken to state mortuary until he was identified by his family,” said SAPS spokesman Captain Dumisani Ncongo. Mkhize was buried at Ixopo last Saturday and Mafali in Matatiele last Sunday. The accused is expected to appear in court for a formal bail application today. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
