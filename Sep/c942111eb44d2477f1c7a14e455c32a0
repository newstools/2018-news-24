Police spokesperson Andre de Jager said on Tuesday that the 43-year-old man was on his way home after having lunch at a restaurant in the area when he was attacked. De Jager said it is believed that the man lived in the north of Johannesburg and had only arrived back in the country on Wednesday, from a trip overseas. "When he stopped at a robot, two men traveling on motorcycles pulled up next to him and shot him through the window." "He drove about 100m, got out and collapsed next to his car," De Jager said. He died at the scene. De Jager could not confirm that there were underworld links to his murder. "At this moment, the suspects are unknown. We are investigating a murder case and that will lead us to what we need to know." De Jager said the man's family had not yet been informed, adding that his wife lived overseas.
