Kopano Molelekedi was meant to travel via taxi from her father’s house in Roodepoort to her mother at the Jerusalema informal settlement when she was allegedly hit by a vehicle, police spokesperson Constable Monica Hangwane said. The young girl was apparently crossing the road when she was hit by a car. Hangwane said that, after the accident, the driver of the vehicle apparently picked her up and claimed he would take her to the hospital. "When he saw that the child was dying, he dropped her off at Pennyville Park," she added. Hangwane said a bypasser had discovered Kopano and took her to the Noordgesig Clinic in Soweto. "When she was taken from Pennyville, she was still alive. She died on arrival at the clinic," she said. Hangwane added that the girl was dressed in a uniform when the incident occurred. She said, while the person who dropped little Kopano at Pennyville Park was still unknown, a case of culpable homicide was being investigated by the police. "We have someone who alleges that they saw everything, and we are still trying to find that person so that they can give account of what they say they saw," Hangwane said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
