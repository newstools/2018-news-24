The incident occurred in the city of Kannur, in southwest India's Kerala State. Local media report that banker Shilna and her husband KV Sudhakaran had already tried invitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment twice because they couldn’t conceive naturally but both pregnancies ended in miscarriages after complications. The couple decided to try for a third time and had an appointment at the ARMC Clinic in the city of Kozhikode for another IVF treatment. But husband Sudhakaran was killed after a tipper lorry hit him while he was visiting a construction site for his PhD studies. Shilna decided to go ahead with the IVF treatment days after her husband’s death and managed to conceive twins using his sperm which had been frozen at a cryo-bank storage facility. She’s now given birth to two daughters who weighed 2,3kg and 2,5kg respectively. Mother and daughters are reportedly healthy.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
