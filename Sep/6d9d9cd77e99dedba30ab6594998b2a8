Lethiwe Makhanya A 28-YEAR-OLD police officer appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday for a murder charge. Constable Siphesihle Zulu from Mafakatini but stationed at Boston Police Station, was arrested on Saturday after he allegedly shot and killed Siyanda Mshengu (20) in Mafakatini. Zulu was remanded in custody until September 11 for a formal bail application. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson Moses Dlamini said Zulu was arrested after he handed himself over to the police. “It is alleged that Constable Zulu was a passenger in a Toyota Avanza when two men who were coming from a street tavern approached them and asked for a lift. The police officer then got out of the car and went to speak to one of the men who were asking for a lift and all of a sudden a gunshot went off. “He [police officer] then went back to the car and told the driver that they need to leave because he had accidentally shot someone. “He then asked the driver to take him to the police station but absconded. Later he handed himself over.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
