Police on Thursday attempted to pull over a vehicle being driven by the suspects along the north-bound lane when the two men opened fire. "As police officers attempted to pull over the vehicle, the two occupants allegedly opened fire at police, damaging a police vehicle in the process. The two suspects were fatally wounded during the shootout with police officers," Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed in a statement. Acting KwaZulu-Natal police commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi has commended officers for their bravery during the operation. "Despite being attacked by these armed suspects our police officers fought back. Criminals must know that police officers will always defend themselves and members of the community when they are attacked. We will not be intimidated by these criminals and we will continue with our plans aimed at reining in wanted armed robbers in this province," Mkhwanazi said. Two unlicensed firearms were recovered in the vehicle occupied by the suspects. "It is believed that the men were wanted for a number of armed robbery cases in KwaZulu-Natal," Naicker said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
