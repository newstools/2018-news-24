Jenna Etheridge It would have been hard not to spot one of the largest yachts in the world, which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, as it sailed into the Port of Cape Town on Thursday. The multimillion-dollar blue and white superyacht, Octopus, will remain at anchor in Table Bay overnight and dock in the V&A Waterfront Harbour on Friday. The 126m-long vessel departed from Durban on Monday. It was previously spotted in Cape Town in 2016. The yacht, which has an internal submarine dock, apparently cost at least $200m to build in 2003. The vessel can accommodate up to 26 guests in 13 cabins, and boasts a helicopter, swimming pool, dance floor, and even a music recording studio, according to clubyacht.net and yachtcharterfleet.com. But the luxury yacht is not only used for leisure; it also doubles as a floating research vessel. On Allen's website, it states that the yacht is home to Pagoo, an eight-person submarine that can dive for up to eight hours. It also has a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), equipped with an HD video camera to capture underwater footage at depths of up to 3 000m.

One of the oldest and most endangered species, the coelacanth was thought to have been extinct until it was discovered in 1938 by a South African museum curator on a local fishing trawler.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
