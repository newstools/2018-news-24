"Mzwabantu Mnqojana, 34, was shot dead, while the warrant officer sustained multiple gunshots wounds," Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said in a statement. The warrant officer is recovering in hospital. Police are withholding his name. "It is suspected that the police officer and his nephew were at a tavern in Motherwell when an argument broke out between some patrons and themselves," Naidoo said. The officer and his nephew were allegedly making their way out of the tavern when they stopped in Xhama Street because of a sound coming from under their car. Shortly afterwards, an unknown group of men approached them and shot at them, Naidoo said. The men got away with the service pistol which belonged to the warrant officer. The motive behind the shooting was still unknown and the police had opened a case of murder and attempted murder. Police are calling on any individual with information to come forward. "Information can be communicated to our toll free Crime Stop number 086 00 10111. Callers may remain anonymous and all information will be treated in the strictest of confidence," Naidoo concluded. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
