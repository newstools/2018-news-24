Little Karusha Govender wrote a letter to Ramaphosa which he read out while addressing community members in Chatsworth, Durban, in KwaZulu-Natal. Carrying Karusha on his left arm, Ramaphosa read: "Hello, Mister President – that’s me (to laughter) – Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika, I love you, you are the best president – that's me (more laughter)." "This is from this lovely young lady, and I’m taking you home with me," Ramaphosa quipped. It is then brought to Ramaphosa's attention that Karusha wanted to speak as well. The president helps to get the microphone within Karusha's reach, and she says in a crystal-clear voice: "Hello President Cyril Ramaphosa, how are you today? My name is Karusha Govender. I saw you on TV and that you like to walk. Please come and walk with me while I ride my bicycle?" Karusha then asks Ramaphosa to "make South Africa the best country in the whole wide world. Thank you, I love you". Ramaphosa was on Saturday addressing community members in Chatsworth as part of the ANC’s Conversations with the President initiative. In his address, Ramaphosa recalled the love that former president Nelson Mandela had for Chatsworth and how this community held a special place in his heart.
