"Information filtering from the scene indicated that the accident was between a school bus and a bakkie," the province's emergency medical services spokesperson Robert McKenzie said. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said the head-on collision resulted in the bus going down an embankment while the Fortuner remained on the road. The vehicle's two occupants died, while a child has been airlifted to a local hospital in critical condition. The bus passengers did not sustain serious injuries, he said. The scene has since been cleared.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
