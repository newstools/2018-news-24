Lieutenant Colonel Amanda Funani said the Mahikeng Flying Squad and the town's business watch apprehended the man in Setlagole village outside Mahikeng at about 15:00 on Wednesday. He is alleged to have shot and killed his 29-year-old girlfriend and her 52-year-old mother on Tuesday morning in Lonely Park. A two-year-old child and a 25-year-old man were also shot but survived. The shooter ran away afterwards. The toddler is being treated in the Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital in Johannesburg. North West police commissioner Lieutenant General Baile Motswenyane commended the officers and business watch members for the arrest. Motswenyane urged people to resolve their differences amicably rather than resorting to violence. The cause of the shooting is not yet clear. The man is expected to appear in the Mahikeng Magistrate's Court on Friday.
