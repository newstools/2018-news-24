Little Amber Yoon’s mom, Belinda, told 9News her daughter could have died if a teacher hadn’t run over to free her. “I was feeling very scared. I thought I was going to die,” the young girl told Perth Now. "And I was scared I was going to get into trouble.” She added that after the incident occurred the teacher thought she’d had something to do with the stunt. “She was holding the skipping rope in her hand and said, ‘You do understand we are going to tell your mom and dad, right?’” Amber said. The mom alleges that the school her daughter attends, Queen of Apostles, a Catholic school, didn’t let her or her husband, Dave, know anything about what had happened to her daughter or seek medical attention for the little girl, despite the principal requiring that Amber, the perpetrator and two witnesses write down exactly what had happened, reports the Mirror. Belinda asked a friend to pick Amber up from school that day and only found out about what had happened after her daughter got home. Amber was born with her oesophagus detached from her stomach and a hole in her heart, which resulted in cardiac arrest when she was just five months old. Belinda immediately contacted police after she discovered what had happened and they’ve confirmed they’re investigating the matter.
