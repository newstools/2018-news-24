The City announced on Friday that water tanks would be removed from the area, located in the north of Gauteng. After the protests about two months ago, the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) met with the City and the provincial Department of Water and Sanitation to discuss the issue. This, after residents laid several complaints with the commission saying that their right to clean water was being violated. But on Friday, the City gave the water the green light and spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said water provision would be done through the normal pipeline. "We wish to convey our appreciation to the residents for their patience and co-operation whilst the City sought to maintain water quality to the required standard," Mashigo said. SAHRC spokesperson Buang Jones told News24 that they were expecting to meet with the Department of Water and Sanitation soon regarding the action plan and steps taken to improve the water in the area. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
