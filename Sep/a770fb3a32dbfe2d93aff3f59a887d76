TMPD spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said 250 taxis were taken off the road since the operation started on Sunday, September 2. Law enforcement officials found that most drivers did not have driving permits and driver's licences, and there were instances in which taxis were not roadworthy, he added. "This is a response to various complaints about taxis throughout Tshwane that [they] contravene most traffic laws," Mahamba said. He added that 50 of the taxis were impounded on September 4 and 5 during an operation in Pretoria West. "The operations will continue to be conducted throughout Tshwane in order to fight unlawfulness on the roads, especially by taxi drivers," he said.
