But they have managed to decrease that consumption to about 500 liters. We thank the people of Cape Town for their efforts.” Cape Town residents have been calling for water restrictions to be relaxed since dam levels have increased, but the department of water and sanitation said peole should wait a little longer. Sputnik Ratau, a spokesperson for the department said: “We still don’t know what will happen in the next few weeks in terms of rain, even though the water situation has improved slightly. “A decision was taken to wait until the end of September for a review of the situation.” The City of Cape Town has called for water restriction levels for urban users to be slightly relaxed from 45% to 40%. Last week, acting Cape Town mayor Ian Neilson said: “As the water supply situation has improved adequately, it’s essential that an appropriate relexation of restrictions takes place as soon as possible. This is not only so that economic activity can be improved, but also so that water tariffs can be relaxed from the current high levels to give the necessary tariff relief to households and businesses.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
