Motsoeneng, who previously served as COO of the public broadcaster, wanted to be reinstated as group executive for corporate affairs. Motsoeneng was dismissed in 2017 after he was found to have brought the public broadcaster into disrepute during a media conference he called to discuss the introduction of the infamous 90% local music quota to the broadcaster. The SABC has welcomed the CCMA's decision. Read: Hlaudi Motsoeneng takes SCA punitive cost order to ConCourt "The decision vindicates the SABC's processes as procedurally and substantively fair.

The SABC says it "remains committed to enforcing sound governance procedures aimed at re-establishing a culture of accountability within the public broadcaster". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
