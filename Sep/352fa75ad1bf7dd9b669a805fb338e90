"The right to privacy is not confined to a home or private dwelling. It will not be a criminal offence for an adult person to use or be in possession of cannabis in private space," Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said on Tuesday. Scroll down for the full judgment. READ: ConCourt rules that personal use of dagga is not a criminal offence The landmark judgment did not specify what amount of dagga constituted private use, and followed a decision of the Western Cape High Court which ruled sections 4(b) and 5(b) of the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act and section 22A(9)(a)(i) of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act as unconstitutional. "This judgment must, thus, not be read to extend any further than the narrow confines of the dispute as I have defined it," the Western Cape High Court emphasised.

Parliament has to amend specific legislation to harmonise it with the court's judgment.

"Congratulations to the great Ras Gareth Prince and Jeremy David Acton. Thanks to you, the healing herb that helped my late brother with his cancer is now free," wrote Ross Hooper.
