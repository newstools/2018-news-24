A Minnesota firefighter’s wife speaks out for the first time
after her husband left in the middle of their wedding celebrations on 1
September to tend to a nearby fire. When her groom, Jeremy Bourasa (39), heard about a house
burning down nearby, she knew he wouldn’t be able to ignore the call, reports Metro. After the couple incurred problems with their original
venue, they decided to have their wedding at the St Paul Park Volunteer Fire
Department in Minnesota, US, where Jeremy works as a volunteer. The 39-year-old rushed to don his uniform and ran outside of
the venue, with wedding photographer, December Orpen, taking pictures of his
departure. “At first I looked at him like, ‘No, don’t even think about
it,’ and he wasn’t going to think about it,” newlywed Krista told People. It was only after an urgent call came from more firefighters
and pictures were shared of how bad the fire was that the bride understood the
urgency of the situation, reports KARE

‘Go ahead and go babe, you’re fine. Just go help them and come back when you
can,’” she told the news outlet.  Kirsti was the reason he joined the squad in the first place
after her niece and nephew died in a house fire in Ohio two years ago. Jeremy, who returned to the wedding celebrations after three
hours – just in time to take part in a first dance with his wife – says he felt
even more blessed to have her in his life. “That just kind of put the icing on the cake that I know
she’s the one for the rest of my life,” said Jeremy. “Once it was all over and I was sitting there with my jacket
off and a wet towel on my head drinking water, I was like, ‘dang, I just got
married!’” Sources: Metro,
