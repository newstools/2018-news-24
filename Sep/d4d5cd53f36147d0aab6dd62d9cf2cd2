George Themba, believed to be from Harare in Zimbabwe, has been charged with nine counts of culpable homicide after nine people died during Friday's crash. Initially it had been reported that 10 people had died. On Monday, News24 reported that the driver had been arrested while allegedly trying to cross the border into Zimbabwe. However, police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Themba was allegedly caught hidden inside a goods trailer while trying to cross the border. He had been taken to hospital for medical treatment shortly after the accident, along with 51 other injured passengers. "As the process of intensive investigations by the police was unfolding, especially on the possible cause of that accident, he then disappeared following his discharge from hospital and fled towards the Beitbridge port of entry," Ngoepe alleged. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
