Jyothi Laldas A SUNDUMBILI police officer was shot and killed during an alleged domestic dispute on Saturday. According to KwaZulu-Natal SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker, the victim was 40-year-old Sergeant Nonhlanhla Lindiwe Mazibuko from the Mandeni Police Station. “She sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the body and died at the scene,” Naicker said in a statement. According to police information, Mazibuko was off duty in Bhidla Section, Sundumbili. She was reportedly with her partner when the incident occurred at around 5:30 pm. Following the incident, her 43-year-old partner handed himself over to the police. The suspect is expected to appear in court soon on a murder charge. A firearm suspected to have been used in the incident was also recovered and will be sent for ballistic testing. Mazibuko’s colleagues at the Mandeni SAPS expressed their sadness at losing a fellow officer, saying she will be missed dearly and that her contributions to the force will live on through them. Commenting through a statement, acting provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi condemned the killing, saying the SAPS was “angered and disturbed” by Mazibuko’s murder. “The South African Police Services has been robbed of yet another foot soldier in a such an unnecessary and tragic manner. “We extend our deepest condolences to her family and colleagues who are understandably still shocked. Our Employee Health and Wellness officials will render the necessary support to them during this unfortunate period,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
