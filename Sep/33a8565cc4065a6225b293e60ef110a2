Twenty-six-year-old Asanda Pityana appeared in the Motherwell Magistrate's Court on Tuesday following her arrest last week. She had initially been charged with attempted murder and child abandonment. A trail of blood from the afterbirth led police to her home after she had allegedly abandoned the newborn at the dumpsite. The baby was discovered by a community member who heard his cries in the early hours of the morning. "On taking a closer look, she discovered a newborn baby boy between rubbish, still alive and naked," provincial police spokesperson Andre Beetge said at the time. The infant died at the Dora Nginza Hospital on Monday."A post-mortem will be done tomorrow (Wednesday) so that we can see what the cause of death was," Beetge told News24 on Tuesday.At the time of his discovery, the community had rallied together and donated toys, baby clothes, milk and nappies to the police station. "We received a huge turnout from people from different walks of life who offered help. The people's heart went out for this baby. Our members at the police station were extremely sad by the death of the infant." Beetge said the items would now be split between Dora Nginza Hospital and the Wells Estate Clinic.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
