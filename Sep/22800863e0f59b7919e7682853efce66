The employment-based app serves as a link between potential employers and jobseekers, which will offer short-term job opportunities to the unemployed. “The idea for the app was based on the high level of unemployment in the city and the country in general,” said Kieron Paoli, owner of Ubuntu Net. “We designed the app to assist those who do not have access to labour brokers and the townships falls under that bracket,” said Paoli. Residents of the Walmer townships have already made their way to the Ubuntu Net kiosk, to register a profile for prospective employment. “In 2017 we started working on the initiative and we have realised that unemployment is rising everyday,” Paoli said. An internet café has been set up close to the township to assist jobseekers when creating a profile and for any additional information. “Do not judge me by my successes. Judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again” – the quote from Nelson Mandela hangs on the wall in the shop to help motivate jobseekers. “The shop consists of three employees to help as much as they can to register the unemployed and create active profiles,” Paoli added. As many of the jobseekers do not have a smartphone in their possession to download the app, communication is also done via SMS on a regular cellphone. “They have to provide proof of identification, proof of address and banking details to register on the app,” said Paoli. Once jobseekers have created an active profile, it allows them to apply for a variety of jobs in various industries. “They will have access to apply in seven industries, namely agriculture, mining, retail, manufacturing, business services, hospitality and personal services. “The employers then search for candidates with the necessary skills and hire accordingly. “Once they start working, the employer can rate and review them to ensure that their profiles remain active and for their CV to stay updated. “We are also working on the idea to create long-term and permanent employment for the jobseekers,” Paoli added. Residents also have access to create new bank accounts with Nedbank, which is assisting the initiative through information sessions with the community. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
