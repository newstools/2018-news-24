Spokesperson Moses Dlamini said IPID was one of the first victims of state capture. "We were also the first ones to call it out," he said. Dlamini said IPID had used the terms "quiet or silent coup" and "political gangsterism" to describe state capture.

The public hearings will continue on Monday with the testimony of representatives of banks regarding the closure of Gupta-related accounts.
