A British woman was found dead in her home just hours after she paid tribute to her late daughter who’d died in a car crash. On 15 September Natalie Hood, from Dover in Kent, England, wrote on Facebook: “Thanks for everybody’s kind thoughts, prayers and memories. Casey was truly one of a kind and I’m sitting here, struggling [with the realisation] that I will never see, hear or feel her presence again. Kids please play safe. “I just want my little girl back xxx.” Natalie’s body was discovered in her home the following day. The cause of death is yet to be determined, Mirror Online reports. Casey Hood (18) was pronounced dead on the accident scene in Womenswold, Kent. The car she’d been travelling in crashed in the early hours of Friday morning. Her friend Lucy Leadbeater (27), who was with her in the vehicle, died two days later in hospital after her parents decided to turn off the life-support machines, The Metro writes. The two men who were with them in the car are said to be in a stable condition. “Officers were on patrol when their attention was drawn to a Toyota Yaris parked on the A2 slip road towards Adisham Road at 3:48am on Friday,” a spokesman for the Kent police said. “The [police] vehicle left the scene and the officers subsequently attended Nethersole Road where they found the car had been involved in a collision.” Mourners have since laid flowers at the crash scene and tributes to the two young women have been pouring in on social media. “Rest in peace. It’s so sad to hear. Anything can happen to anyone at any time. We just have to make the most of the time we have here. RIP,” one person commented. Another wrote: “So sad to hear about Casey Hood and now her mum Natalie. She was always offering help to me with things.” Sources: The Sun, The Metro, Mirror Online
