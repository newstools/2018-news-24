Only President Trump seems to be thinking clearly on this topic. While Mr Trump generally comes across as a muddled thinker, the emotional issue of land seizure is quite simply an atrocity. Think about it for a moment. Think about it without emotion. Think about it like it would be handled in a court of law. Lets have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Land seizure with or without compensation, Mr Ramaphosa, is still a "land grab". It cannot be defended on historical grounds (a very murky area). It cannot be defended on economic grounds: without doubt an economic disaster waiting to happen. And it absolutely cannot be defended on moral or ethical grounds. The ANC's arguments to support land seizure are weak at best; worth a very close examination (enter Mr Trump). Suffice it to say the land "issue" was never an "issue" until the ANC made it an "issue" in 2017. The whole concept that the ancestors of one racial group may, or may not, have owned land; that may, or may not, have been taken away from them by the ancestors of another racial group; and therefore that group may, or may not, have inherited the land to the present day; that this justifies taking land away from current owners, is simply an abomination. By any standard of decency, this is a crime against humanity.
