Msimanga's office on Saturday said he would listen to and engage with residents about issues they face on a daily basis, Democratic Alliance spokesperson Charity Moyo said. Moyo said, Msimanga, who is the DA's Gauteng premier candidate, will listen to what the people of Gauteng want and expect from [their] government. "The Listening Tour will kick off at Pretoria Metrorail Train Station where the Premier Candidate will engage with commuters and will travel on a train from Pretoria Metrorail Train Station to Saulsville Metrorail Train Station," Moyo said. Msimanga embarks on the tour having survived a motion of no confidence on Thursday in the Tshwane city council. A first motion brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters was disallowed on a procedural point. The second motion was not put to a vote after its holders, the African National Congress, walked out ahead of its tabling. The EFF has said it would approach the court to have the speaker's decision overturned, and would write to the speaker again to have the motion heard at the council's next sitting. The ANC and EFF would have had to vote together with their combined 106 votes to remove Msimanga. Msimanga's listening tour will also include door-to-door engagements with the residents of Saulsville and Atteridgeville to get input ahead of next year's general elections.
