"Detectives believe that the man in the attached identikits can be of assistance in solving the case," said police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker. Thembi Mbongwa, who was a councillor candidate in eMalahleni, Newcastle, was killed in July 2016 in front of her husband and children. She was at home when two men entered and shot her. Police minister Bheki Cele established the task team two months ago to mitigate political killings in embattled KZN. It made 28 arrests so far, he said at the time. Last week, Cele attributed the arrest of a man, in connection with the murder of former ANC Youth League secretary general Sindiso Magaqa, to the task team. Magaqa, a ward councillor in Umzimkhulu, died in Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban in September from gunshot wounds he sustained in a suspected ambush on July 13. He was 35 years old. Sibusiso Malusi Ncengwa, 30, accused of Magaqa's murder, appeared in a packed Umzimkhulu Magistrate's Court on Thursday under a heavy police presence. His case was postponed to October 25 for a provisional indictment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
