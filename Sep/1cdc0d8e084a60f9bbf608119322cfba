Mumun Muafiyah posted that she’d started having contractions while she was being driven to hospital in the Indonesian city of Cilegon. The hospital is about 25km away from her home. They’d only gone 5km when she gave birth to the first baby. Another 5km later, Mumun gave birth to the second baby. Five minutes after that she was left surprised when a third baby was born. The shocked mom told local media she’d been told by a gynaecologist that she was carrying only twins. Only after all three babies were born did she manage to arrive at the hospital, where the newborns were then given medical care. Doctors confirmed they were all healthy. In Indonesia surnames aren’t used, which allows parents the freedom to choose the child’s whole names, so Mumun decided to use the name of the car her children were born in. The triplets are Nazrina Khaira Avanza, Nazrina Haura Avanza and Nazrina Khaula Avanza. A spokesman for Toyota in Indonesia confirmed they’d been told about the honour. “We want to congratulate dad Azri Prihatna and the mother for the birth of their triplets in the cabin of an Avanza on the way to the hospital. We’re joining in their happiness and pray that the mother and the triplets are in good health." Last year another Indonesian man named his baby Pajero Sport, which earned him a package of baby supplies. The regent of Karawang, Cellica Nurrachadiana, was named after the Toyota Celica. But this pales in comparison to the Indonesian child named Honda Suzuki Impalawati. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
