According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), the trio, who are from separate districts, appeared in different magistrate's courts in Limpopo where they are standing trial for corruption, theft and defeating the ends of justice. Nine other officers are expected to go to trial soon. "This comes after they were shamefully arrested by members of the Road Traffic Management Corporation's anti-corruption unit, together with the Hawks," said RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane. "In December 2017, 20 people including traffic officers, licensing officers and their civilian collaborators were arrested in Tzaneen and Greater Letaba municipal area," Zwane said. "The officials were arrested after months of intensive intelligence gathering and observation where they were identified while engaging in unethical and corrupt activities." RTMC CEO advocate Makhosini Msibi said this trial would send a strong message that corruption and misconduct by officials will not be tolerated within the ranks of traffic officers. He added that the RTMC believes it has a strong case against the accused.
