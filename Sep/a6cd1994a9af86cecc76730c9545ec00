"The case was remanded for the 19th of September for further investigations and the minor will remain in custody," North West police spokesperson Captain Sam Tselanyane told News24. The minor was arrested last Thursday and is facing a murder charge. Basic education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga previously told News24 that it appeared that there had been an altercation the day before the incident between Gadimang Mokolobate and the teenager about feeding him. "He was in a queue and was reprimanded by the teacher. He took it personally and went home and came back today (Thursday) and found the teacher inside the classroom, where he stabbed him," Mhlanga said Basic Educaton Minister Angie Motshekga paid a visit to the slain teacher's family on Monday afternoon.  "The Minister went to send her condolences and provide support for the family of Gadimang Mokolobate," spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga told News24. The minister is expected to return to the family home on Thursday for Mokolobate's memorial service. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
