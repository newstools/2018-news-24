Amanjee (Grade 10 last year) then went on to be the winner at the Eskom Expo for Young Scientists International Science Fair, taking the prize for Best in Innovation category and walked away with a cash prize as well as an invitation to the Özkaya Education-Karademir Science Energy Engineering Fair (OKSEF). His project “Footbit, Step into the Future”, involves piezoelectricity. The idea is to convert kinetic energy to electrical energy. Amanjee investigated it as a viable renewable energy source as a number of people in South Africa still do not have access to electricity.  He aimed to find a hidden base of electricity for people to use and had the honour of representing the country at the prestigious Africa Science Buskers Festival (ASBF) which took place in Lusaka last month, where he won first prize in innovation and was shortlisted to represent Africa in Turkey later this year. At International Science Fair 2017, students took home bursaries, cash and other exciting prizes, including an honour to represent the country at other international science fairs. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
