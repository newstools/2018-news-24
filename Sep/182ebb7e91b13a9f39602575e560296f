Katy Williams and her son, Finn (3), had been waiting for her husband, Sam, to return from a trail run on the Blyde Wildlife Estate near Hoedspruit when they were attacked by a female giraffe which had recently given birth. The animal viciously kicked both mother and son. Marina Botha, family spokesperson, confirmed in a statement that US-born Katy had regained consciousness but that Finn was still under sedation. “Her injuries make communication hard and we’re using hand gestures to communicate,” Marina said. Sam said in a statement he was overjoyed that his wife had regained consciousness. “It was amazing to see Katy wake up and to be able to talk to her and to reassure her that we are there for her,” he said. “Finn has been stable and doctors are satisfied with his condition under the circumstances,” he added. “I hope that in time he will also wake up so that we can all be reunited as a family.” Katy’s father, Jack Standish, and his son, David, in the meantime have arrived in South Africa from the US. “There’s nothing worse than for a dad to have to travel more than 3 000 km because something like this has happened to your daughter and grandson,” he said in a statement. Katy and Finn are in the Busamed Modderfontein Hospital.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
