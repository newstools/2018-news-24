On August 24, they commemorated Women’s Month by hosting an event in the Khanyiselani Development Trust boardroom where various speakers delivered motivational talks. Disabled women from the Mount Currie Disabled Women’s Organisation attended the event with their chairperson Nontsikelelo Phakane, who called for women to be given equal opportunities in both government and private sectors. She said the organisation was established in 2009 to empower disabled women with skills and motivation, saying: “Disabled women from Kokstad have formed a partnership whereby they will make school uniforms for local schools.” The event was jointly organised by Khanyiselani Development Trust, Khanyiselani Pre-School and Mount Currie Disabled Women’s Organisation. Guest speaker Ntombizodwa Mdingi of Khanyiselani Clinic said she encouraged disabled women to portray abundant love in their families and told them to grab any opportunities that would allow them to work and feed their families. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
