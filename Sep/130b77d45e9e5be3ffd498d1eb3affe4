This on a weekend in which the Bay remembered the 50th anniversary of the 1968 floods that wreaked havoc in the city. Welcome rain of about 40mm was measured in the catchment areas, but at time of going to print on Monday, the dam levels were not yet available. This rain follows on a spike in the use of water in the metro due to the 2018 Isuzu Ironman 70.3 World Championships. The drought-stricken Nelson Mandela Bay faced tougher water restrictions over the last few months when dam levels dropped to an all-time low of 20% of total combined capacity. This resulted in the daily usage of 50 litres per person per day. Nelson Mandela Bay’s total combined capacity of water supply dropped to 17.95% as on August 29. The capacity was 18.2% in the previous week. Approximately 16 000 visitors set foot in the city ahead of the 2018 Isuzu Ironman 70.3 World Championship, to gear up for the triathlon which was held this past Saturday and Sunday. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesperson, Mthubanzi Mniki, confirmed that the municipality has taken every possible precaution to prevent excessive amounts of water consumption during the Ironman World Championships.
