	        Send us your pictures   ·  Send us your stories Rapulana Seiphemo appeared in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial
Crime Court on Wednesday morning on charges of tax evasion. The Generations: The Legacy actor faces five counts of
contravening the tax laws due to his failure to submit personal income tax
returns to the South African Revenue Service from 2013 to 2017. The matter has been postponed to October 18. "The matter has been postponed because he indicated to
the court that he wishes to make representations to the NPA," National Prosecuting
Authority spokesperson Phindi Louw-Mjonondwane said outside court. Rapulana arrived early for the court proceedings, wearing a
blue shirt and black jeans, but did not speak to the media. He apparently owes SARS more than R48 000, but due to
penalties incurred over the years, this amount has risen to more than R167 000. DRUM contacted SARS spokesperson Sicelo Mkosi to confirm the
amount owed by the actor, but no response was received at the time of
publication. More details to follow.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
