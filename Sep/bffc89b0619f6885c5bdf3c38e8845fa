Heavy rains and incidents of flash flooding may affect parts of the Western and Eastern Cape, particularly along the southern and south-eastern coast. "This extreme, wintery weather is likely to include snowfalls, accompanied by widespread, bitterly cold conditions over many parts of South Africa, with coldness persisting for a four to five-day period in some places," a statement said. The Western and Eastern Cape, and to a lesser extent the Northern Cape, will be the most adversely affected. The highveld region of the Free State, North West, Gauteng and Mpumalanga as well as parts of KwaZulu-Natal may experience isolated storms.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
