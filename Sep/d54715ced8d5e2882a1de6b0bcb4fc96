He celebrated his birthday on Monday 3 September. Kennedy has lived in the community for 55 years, living a healthy lifestyle, and is still going strong. He says his best recipe for living long and enjoying the benefits of life is being a nice person who is always ready to embrace change and be flexible. “I suppose love has kept me going all these years. Be a kind person. Always help your neighbour. Just make the best of whatever life throws at you.” Kennedy has allowed himself to change with time and adapt to the new world gained after the birth of technology and democracy. “I have always been someone to go with the flow and take one day at a time. “Even I have a tablet and mobile phone so I suppose anybody can adapt to technology­.” He says throughout his life he has been involved in various sports codes such as gymnastics and played goalkeeper for Caledonians­. Today he is still fit and plays league darts for Travellers Darts Club. He loves exercising and doing crosswords to keep his mind active and his brain healthy. He has never smoked and eats healthily. Kennedy says he is grateful for being able to see his grandchildren and great-grandchildren grow up. He managed to get through the pain of losing his wife of 42 years and even found new love again. “I am now happy with my partner of 14 years, Lorraine,” he says. Jeanne Mackay describes her father as “an amazing man with a zest for life”. “We are very blessed to have him in our life and are so proud of him. He is known and loved by many in the community.”   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
