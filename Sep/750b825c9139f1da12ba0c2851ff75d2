Kaveel Singh The KwaZulu-Natal task team investigating political killings has appealed to the public for help in tracing the killers of Richmond Municipality manager Sibusiso Sithole and has released identikits of two men who might be able to shed some light on the murder. "Detectives believe that the two men in the attached identikits can be of an assistance in the investigation," provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said. Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of the two men can contact Sergeant Mkhabela on 079 500 1341 or Crime Stop 08600 10111, Naicker added. The 39-year-old was assassinated outside a local police station in March 2017 after being lured out of his office in Victoria Road in Richmond. At the time of the murder, Community Safety MEC Mxolisi Kaunda's spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane said the MEC was concerned that Richmond was slowly regaining the reputation it had in the late 1990s as the killing fields of KwaZulu-Natal. There have been more than 100 deaths linked to political killings in the province in the past four years alone. In the KZN legislature last week, Premier Willis Mchunu released the Moerane Commission report on political killings. The final report pointed to a number of failures by the government, political parties and ultimately, material greed. While not providing too much detail at the time of the release of the report, Mchunu was adamant that the provincial government would move swiftly to apply recommendations to relevant parties.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
