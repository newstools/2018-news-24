The man was found lying next to his bicycle on the right-hand side of the road at 07:30 when paramedics arrived at the scene. "Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead," ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "No vehicle was found on the scene." Meiring confirmed that local authorities were on the scene to investigate further. Meanwhile, only 21 kilometres away in Phoenix, a man was hit by a BMW while crossing the M41. Crisis Medical spokesperson Kyle van Reenen said that the man sustained head injuries and polytrauma. "He was obviously in a critical condition when we found him. So, we enlisted the help of the IPSS helicopter," he said. "He was being taken to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital, but he went into cardiac arrest." After many attempts to revive him, paramedics got a pulse and transported him to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital. The patient died when he arrived at the hospital. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
