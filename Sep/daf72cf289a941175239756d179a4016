According to Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, police confiscated 22 200 capsules of heroin, 2826 pieces of rock cocaine and 505 mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of R1.3 million. The operation was conducted by the Provincial Organised Crime Unit, Provincial Drug Unit and Umlazi K9 after an intensive investigation that took police almost two weeks to conclude. After all the evidence was gathered police pounced on the suspects who were found in a building used to manufacture and package drugs. The suspects were immediately arrested and charged for dealing in drugs. The two suspects appeared in the Chatsworth Magistrates Court on Monday and were remanded in custody until 19 September 2018 for a formal bail application. Police in the province have vowed not to take their foot off initiatives aimed at eradicating the drug scourge in KwaZulu-Natal.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
