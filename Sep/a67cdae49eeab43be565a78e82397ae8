According to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Lt Colonel Thulani Zwane, the woman had initially reported that she was raped on Thursday at Cottonlands in Verulam. The case was reported to police a day after the incident and detectives took over the docket. A few days after that a man then alleged that he was hijacked by two suspects on Old Main Road in Tongaat on 13 September 2018 and the case was opened at Tongaat police station. As the investigation was ongoing, detectives were alerted to a video put on social media by a security company which showed the man and the woman getting robbed while allegedly engaging in sexual activities near a sugar cane field in Verulam. This put the suspects at a different location at the time when the man said he was hijacked and woman said she was raped. Tongaat detectives were able to link these cases and both the man and woman were arrested and charged for defeating the ends of justice. Police are warning members of the community to refrain from reporting false cases as police resources are wasted when police spend time and money investigating these matters. Police take all reports of crime seriously and those that open false cases will be caught out.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
