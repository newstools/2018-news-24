Nair was arrested last Wednesday and faces charges of crimen injuria and incitement of public violence. In an almost five-minute video clip posted on social media, Nair said: "I... do hereby call for that k****r state president Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, yes I mean the k****r state president Cyril Ramaphosa, to be charged for frauding (sic) this nation, for oppressing this nation, for high treason, for failing and he's the source to (sic) all crime, violence, poor healthcare, poverty that prevails in a so-called true democracy." His family later issued a statement saying he was mentally unwell and that they did not support his views. He appeared in court on September 21 and was kept in custody for his bail application. His appearance comes after estate agent Vicki Momberg was found guilty on four counts of crimen injuria on November 3. Momberg's racist rant was aimed a black police officer, who had helped her after an alleged smash-and-grab incident in Northriding, Johannesburg. She used the k-word 48 times. In March, she was sentenced to three years in prison, of which one year was suspended. She has been granted leave to appeal the conviction and sentence and was granted R 2 000 bail in August. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
