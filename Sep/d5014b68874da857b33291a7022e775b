The suspects invaded two houses at extension 19, Olievenhoutbosch in the early hours of Friday morning, police spokesperson Constable Tumisang Moloto said. Moloto said the men allegedly entered the house at around 01:00, threatened a woman and took three phones before fleeing. They proceeded to the next-door neighbour where they further robbed a 59-year-old man of his personal items, he said. "A team of detectives was assembled immediately to track down the suspects and it yielded results when three suspects were arrested in [the] Olievenhoutbosch area within a period of less than eight hours," Moloto said. He said the fourth suspect was still at large. "We appeal to the residents of Olievenhoutbosch to assist the police with information which could lead to the arrest of the fourth suspect to come forward," Moloto added. He said a case of possession of suspected stolen items had been opened for investigation. The arrested suspects will appear before the Pretoria Magistrate Court on Monday, Moloto added.
