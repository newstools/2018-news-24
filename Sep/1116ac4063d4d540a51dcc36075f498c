Jenni Evans Two people have been shot dead during ongoing violence and shop looting in Dobsonville, Soweto, police have told News24. WatchWATCH A Brixton shop owner of Bangladeshi descent, and his brother, narrowly escaped death on Saturday morning when their shop was torched, Johannesburg police said. Spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said the owner of Nahid Cash Store in High Street was asleep with his brother when he heard a window shattering at 05:10. "He woke up to investigate and saw something that looks like liquid dripping next to his bed. The next thing the fire erupted," said Masondo. He and his brother fled the shop from another door and the shop was gutted.  The fire department came out and people from the flats upstairs were safely evacuated. The blaze was doused and the flats upstairs appear to have been spared. Nobody was injured and police would investigate further. The owners are estimated to have lost stock worth R150 000 and cash. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
