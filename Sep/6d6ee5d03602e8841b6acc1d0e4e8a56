The children, aged between three and six, were apparently alone at the home when a blanket caught fire, Alexandra police spokesperson Captain Stephen Malatji said. It is believed that five children were in the house and that their mothers were out drinking. The eldest, who is 14, managed to escape and seek help, Malatji said. "Three kids were from one mother and the other from another," Malatji said.
