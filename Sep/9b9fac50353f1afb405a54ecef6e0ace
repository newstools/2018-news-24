"His bail has been denied," said Lieutenant General Katlego Mogale. Zalman Orlianski became involved in a row over parking with Tebogo Makhalemele, an Uber driver, at OR Tambo International Airport on Sunday September 9 and was injured when the argument escalated. The Uber driver was arrested initially on charges of assault, but this was changed to attempted murder when the extent of injuries sustained by the 71-year-old man became evident. Orlianski died on Sunday night. When the driver appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on Monday, his charges were amended from attempted murder to murder and the case was postponed to Tuesday. On Tuesday, he was not granted bail, and will remain in custody until his next appearance on October 25. Uber has stated that the driver has been removed from its app. It said he had no previous incidents and had an above-average rating. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
