"The State has come to its senses," lawyer Daniel Zantsi said after his client left Bellville Magistrate's Court a free man on Wednesday. Zantsi explained that in Mahilihili's case, the interdict which he was alleged to have violated during the #FeesMustFall protests of 2015, had "lost its value" because CPUT and other institutions had found ways to amicably resolve issues with students. In August, students held a demonstration outside Parliament to say they should not be branded criminals. This was because even the government agreed with their cause by pumping billions more into the funding of tertiary education Vernac News reported that Mahilihili had faced charges of trespassing and malicious damage to property. A warrant of arrest had been executed after Mahilihili failed to arrive at court last week, leading to him being taken to Goodwood Prison for a week.

"He spent seven days behind bars when he was not even supposed to be arrested," said Zantsi. But now that the ordeal is over, his client is planning to return to his studies and to find work to assist his family financially. "He feels very rejuvenated," said Zantsi.
