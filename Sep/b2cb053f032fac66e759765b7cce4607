The teenager is facing a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday. "The department condemns an incident where a 19-year-old learner from Hoërskool Oosterland assaulted a bus driver on Thursday, 12 September 2018, afternoon on their way home," departmental spokesperson Jasper Zwane wrote in a statement on Tuesday. The department will await recommendations from the high school following the disciplinary hearing. Mpumalanga Education MEC Sibusiso Malaza said he was horrified that a school pupil could place others at risk through his violent actions. "One cannot imagine that a learner can conduct himself in such a horrible manner. It's really so unfortunate and heartbreaking. There is nothing that can justify violent conduct and disregard for the safety of other learners," he said. The department insists said the matter would be investigated and that "decisive action will be taken against the offending learner".  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
