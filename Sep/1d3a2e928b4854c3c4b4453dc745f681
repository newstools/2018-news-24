Earlier this month, Katy's husband Dr Sam Williams returned from a trail run on Blyde Wildlife Estate in Hoedspruit to find his wife and their son under attack from a giraffe that had recently given birth to a calf. The attack happened 150 metres from the family's home, where Finn usually waits for Sam to return from his run. It is presumed that the giraffe attacked Katy and Finn because she viewed the two as a threat to her newborn calf.
