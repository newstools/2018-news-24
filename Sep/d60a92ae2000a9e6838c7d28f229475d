Thami Ka-Nkosi THE renting out and selling of RDP (low cost) houses has become a great concern in the Ray Nkonyeni Municipality. Some community members had raised their concerns about people who were renting out RDP houses while there were poor people who were still on the waiting list for such properties. A source known to the Fever said renting a low cost house costs around R500 to R600 a month. “I am also renting one, and paying R600 a month,” he said. “The owner of the house lives in his other house in Mthwalume.” He added that this was the norm in Mkholombe, Masinenge and Louisiana with many people renting out their houses for additional income while they stayed elsewhere. “There are government officials who can afford their own houses, but live in these areas because it’s free,” he alleged. At a monthly media briefing last Tuesday, Mayor Cynthia Mqwebu said it is illegal to rent out a government house because these houses are meant for those who cannot afford to build their own homes. She also emphasised that people should be very careful when they buy these houses, because the title deeds are still in the owner’s name.
