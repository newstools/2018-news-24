A ministry statement on Monday warned that Mkhize did not have a personal account on the social media site. "Basically the [fake accounts] were talking about the work the minister was doing," spokesperson Legadima Leso explained to News24 on Monday. "There wasn't too much negativity, but obviously when one talks about hirings and job positions... soon people would start calling for people to apply and we wanted the public to know that this was not the minister's account." They have requested Facebook shut down activity on the fake accounts. Another account under the name "Zweli Mkhize" had a sexually explicit profile picture attached to it. Leso said the department was not aware of that account specifically, but that the warning to the public remained the same - that they should not engage with the users of those accounts. Those who wished to contact the minister via social media have been invited to do so via Twitter account @DrZweliMkhize instead or through the Cogta social media platforms - @NationalCoGTA (Twitter) and the national CoGTA Facebook account. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
