Polls that will likely pit new president Emmerson Mnangagwa and opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the Movement for Democratic Change as the two main contenders are due before August 31. Mnangagwa took over from longtime leader Robert Mugabe following a military takeover last November. Said the Sunday Mail: "Government has selected a company to print ballot papers and supply indelible ink for the forthcoming harmonised elections.... due to security and time considerations." "The tender would normally have been announced in the Government Gazette [but]...it was felt there was not enough time to follow this process," the paper continued. The move will not please Chamisa who made it clear in an interview with the privately-owned Standard newspaper that all political parties had to agree on "who prints the ballot paper". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
