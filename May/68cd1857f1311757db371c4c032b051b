Brig Gen Texas Chukwu said on Monday the hostages were rescued from four villages in the Bama area of Borno State. He did not say when the rescues took place, but said the military and the Multinational Joint Task Force helped with the release of mostly women and children. He said some men who had been forced to become Boko Haram fighters were among those rescued. Boko Haram is responsible for thousands of abductions, especially of young girls and women, during its nine-year insurgency in Nigeria and surrounding countries. Nigeria's army has staged rescues before, but many victims, including some girls abducted from Chibok in 2014, remain missing. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
