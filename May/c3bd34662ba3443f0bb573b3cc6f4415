The suspect was arrested on Monday after police traced him to a tavern in Gelvandale, Port Elizabeth, Colonel Priscilla Naidu said on Tuesday. In November last year, the man allegedly approached a 17-year-old boy on an open field in the Helenvale area and shot at him. The teen ran into the streets and the man continued shooting at him, said Naidu. The teenager sustained a gunshot wound to the neck. However, 2-year-old Akiem Baartman, who was playing in the streets at the time, was struck in the head by a bullet. It is believed the shooting was gang related, Naidu said. The man is expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Thursday.
