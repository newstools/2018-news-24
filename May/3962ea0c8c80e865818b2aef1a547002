Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said his North African nation "will remain a land of peace and tolerance," according to Mosaique radio. He said Tunisians from all religions are "full citizens of this country". Soldiers and other security forces were deployed near the 2 500-year-old Ghriba synagogue, which was targeted in a 2002 extremist attack. The pilgrimage this year gathered about 3 000 pilgrims on Wednesday and Thursday, some coming from Israel, France and Italy. Djerba is home to Tunisia's main Jewish community. Last January, two Molotov cocktails were thrown at two synagogues on the island during protests over price hikes. Authorities say the incident wasn't terror-related. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
