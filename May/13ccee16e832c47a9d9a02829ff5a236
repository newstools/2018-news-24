KwaZulu-Natal Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo told News24 that the Hawks were leading the investigation following the attack at the Imam Hussain Mosque in Ottawa, Verulam, north of Durban on Thursday. "There are elements of extremism that we have noticed. There is some sort of hatred pertaining to religion... hence we're saying there were elements of extremism," said Mhlongo. He said the Hawks were investigating one count of murder, two of attempted murder and one count of assault. READ: Attack on mosque described as a 'heinous' and 'senseless' crime He said the deceased was Abbas Essop, who was in his late 20s. "The two other people are in a critical condition in hospital," he said. No arrests have been made. Mhlongo added that the Hawks were working with the SAPS and local security companies to investigate the matter. He urged anyone with information to contact their local police station.
