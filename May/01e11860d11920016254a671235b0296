Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said Captain Qeya Jonas Tshabalala, 52, was shot and killed after he was attacked while attending to a complaint in Phelindaba. He was attached to the Serious Organised Crime Unit in Bloemfontein. Mulaudzi said two unknown criminals got into the house where Tshabalala was attending to the complaint, when they started shooting "indiscriminately". "The Captain retaliated, wounding one suspect. However he succumbed due to the bullet wounds he sustained after the exchange of gunfire," Mulaudzi said. "The two suspects made off with his official phone, service pistol and the state vehicle which was found abandoned at Dewetsdorp with blood stains inside."

"This is unacceptable and I want to urge members of the community to assist us with any information which could lead to the arrest of the suspects," Matakata said. "There is a suspect who is injured and sooner or later he is going to need medical attention.  We plead with all hospitals, clinics and community members to call the nearest police if they come across that person."
