As a result of her injuries, ‘Siya’ - as she is affectionately known - had to have her right leg amputated above the knee. 
 WATCH An 18-year-old was critically injured when three dogs attacked her at her home in Heuweloord, Centurion, on Wednesday afternoon, paramedics said. Paramedics found the girl lying next to the garage around 12:44, said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring. She had serious bite wounds to her head and upper body, he added. Community members had already managed to move the three dogs away. She was taken to a nearby private hospital for urgent treatment. News24 understands that the dogs, believed to be boerboels/boerboel crosses, were transported to a nearby animal welfare organisation, where a veterinarian was expected to assess them. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the animals. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
