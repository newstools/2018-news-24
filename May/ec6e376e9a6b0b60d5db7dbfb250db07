IT is alleged that on May 17 a 19-year-old woman sent a message to her mother and her boyfriend claiming that she was kidnapped by four unknown men while in the Shiyane area, New Hanover. The “victim’s” mother went to the police station to open a missing persons case and police spent the whole night looking for her. Surprisingly, on Friday she was found at another boyfriend’s house in the New Hanover area. A case of perjury was opened at New Hanover and the suspect was immediately arrested. She appeared in the New Hanover Magistrate’s Court on Monday. KZN Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa condemned the act. “We cannot tolerate people who are opening false cases to satisfy their needs. A lot of manpower and physical resources were used after the case was opened. This arrest will serve as a wakeup call to all those who open false cases that they will be brought before justice and pay for their wrongful deeds,” he said.
