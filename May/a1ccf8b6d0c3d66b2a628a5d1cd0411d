The Sowetan and EWN reported that Manana allegedly tried to push his domestic worker down stairs. The charges were filed on Sunday evening at the Douglasdale police station.

Last year in September, News24 reported that Manana was convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges. The charges related to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6, which was filmed and went viral on social media, sparking a national outcry for his arrest.
