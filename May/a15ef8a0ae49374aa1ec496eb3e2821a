In a brief statement on Wednesday, Tutu said: “Leah and I are very sad that Patricia De Lille’s services will be lost to the City of Cape Town. Although she represented a particular political party, she played an important role as a unifier in a society still bearing the scars of its divided past.” The Democratic Alliance confirmed the cessation of De Lille’s membership from the party on Tuesday, in a statement. James Selfe, Chairperson of the DA’s Federal Executive, made the announcement at a media briefing in Cape Town. The DA charged De Lille with misconduct earlier this year, following various claims of corruption. The embattled mayor survived a motion of no confidence against her in February this year, but in an internal motion of no confidence against her in April, the party voted to recall her as mayor. She has taken her party to court to challenge her expulsion fom the party. The DA cited clause 3.5.1.2 in its constitution, which says that if a member publicly declares his or her intention to resign, then their membership ceases immediately. She said she will challenge the matter in court. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
