He had asked the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court to relax the conditions, particularly the one that specified that he should inform the investigating officer six weeks before he undertakes any international travel. Free State National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phaladi Shuping said Gupta wanted to have that condition amended. "The case was postponed today (Monday) until Friday for judgment," Shuping said.
