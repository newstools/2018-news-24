Langelihle Mazeka, 41, and Nozipho Mnguni, 27, have been missing since December 13, 2017, police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. "They were found yesterday (Monday) at 18:00 at Mpola area near Mhlathuzana River. Although their families identified their clothes, DNA analysis will be conducted to identify the bodies," said Zwane. News24 reported on the couple in January this year, when provincial police first appealed for the public's assistance in tracing them. Mazeka had left his home that night to escort Mnguni, who was his girlfriend, from the hotel where she worked. "Langelihle would always go to escort Nozipho whenever she knocked off late at work," he said. Zwane explained that Mnguni had to walk past a dense Umhlathuzana forest to get to their home. On that night, it is alleged that Mazeka left his cellphone behind and left his home with the light on when he went to meet Mnguni. Both of them never returned and they have been missing since then. Mazeka is originally from Impendle and Mnguni is from Greytown. Police said an inquest docket has been opened for investigation following the discovery of the skeletal remains.
