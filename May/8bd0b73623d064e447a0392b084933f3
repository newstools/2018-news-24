Phindile Shozi FRAUD is said to be on the rise in the Upper Highway area and the Hillcrest SAPS is asking the public to be more attentive when using personal documentation. Hillcrest SAPS communications officer, Captain Linzi Smith said that identity theft and fraud seems to be on the increase in the area and that the residents’ need to be on the look-out when administering their personal stuff. “Residents need to be vigilant when checking their financial accounts because you never know who’s monitoring you,” said Smith. Smith said that residents need to check their accounts regularly and the sooner they notice something out of the ordinary, they should report it. “Residents should never respond to e-mails or cell phone messages appearing to be from your bank, which requests your personal details and also avoid doing internet banking in public areas such as internet cafes, or on any computer that can be accessed by people you do not know,” Smith said. Smith also advised that the public should not save their internet banking password on their desktops: “Change your pin and passwords frequently, always log off at the end of a session and never provide your online ID, password or pin to anyone and never write them down or share them.” Smith added that residents must not leave computers unattended after you have entered your internet banking password: “Always put a sensible transaction limit on your accounts and these tips will help them prevent their identity being stolen and getting defrauded.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
