We got an opportunity to speak to Economic Freedom Fighters North West chairperson Betty Diale, who said factions in the ANC have benefitted the party. She was speaking on the sidelines of the EFF rally to celebrate the party's victory in Coligny. Addressing the crowd, EFF leader Julius Malema said the party is abandoning its court challenge for a secret ballot in the motion of no confidence against Mahumapelo.
