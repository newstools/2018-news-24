A traffic notification, which was attributed to Africa, was doing the rounds on social media on Thursday. It mentioned several road closures and stated that Mitchells Plain residents would be marching to neighbouring township Siqalo on Thursday at 16:00.

Everything is quiet in Mitchells Plain right now, but we are monitoring the situation," Africa said. "If anything should change, I will inform the media." This comes after tensions came to a head between Mitchells Plain and Siqalo residents on Wednesday night. Siqalo residents had earlier embarked on violent protests over housing and service delivery, barricading several entry and exit roads to Mitchells Plain. This in turn angered Mitchells Plain residents who felt they were forced to bear the brunt of the protest. A man was also killed on Wednesday night after a taxi ploughed into a group of protesters while two others were injured when police opened fire with rubber bullets. On Thursday morning, representatives of the Mitchells Plain and Siqalo communities agreed on a ceasefire. Both sides urged residents not to engage in any further protest action.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
