The electoral commission head said on Monday that authorities are studying the irregularities and will announce the preliminary results on Wednesday. State television reported an exit poll from Sunday's vote showing Islamist movement Ennahdha in the lead, followed by President Beji Caid Essebsi's secular moderate party, Nida Tounes. Ennahdha supporters celebrated overnight with fireworks in the capital, Tunis. Turnout in Sunday's vote was just 33%. Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said the "citizens' reticence" was a wake-up call for all politicians and urged more government attention to local concerns. Voter apathy is an especially big problem for Tunisia's youth, disappointed that more hasn't changed since the 2011 revolution, which unleashed uprisings around the Arab world. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
