The group says the wounded sustained gunshot wounds during Tuesday's violence in the PK5 and Fatima neighbourhoods. Anne-Marie Boyeldieu, the head of the aid group's mission in Central African Republic, calls on residents to respect the work of medical staff "regardless of their background, religious or political affiliations." Anger has been high among some Bangui residents after the UN peacekeeping mission and local security forces launched a joint operation in the largely Muslim neighbourhood of PK5 in early April to arrest armed criminal groups. The corpses of 17 civilians were laid out in front of the UN peacekeeping offices in protest shortly afterward. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
