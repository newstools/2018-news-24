He uncharacteristically lashed out at DA MP and chief whip John Steenhuisen, who continuously heckled him during the session. Ramaphosa was answering a question about developing economies when he said: "… you look at Brazil, you look at a number of countries in South East Asia, and shut up, you Steenhuisen, and listen." Steenhuisen reportedly told Ramaphosa: "This isn't the NEC (national executive committee). This is Parliament." Steenhuisen could be heard telling Ramaphosa, while the microphone was off, to toughen up. Twitter had a field day after Ramaphosa lost his cool.

It starts with the opposition being told to shut up, it will soon move to the media and pretty soon all will be 'shut up'. We must always speak up and speak out, it's how democracy is sustained (sic)." DA MP Phumzile van Damme came out defending Steenhuisen, saying a "thick skin" was required in Parliament.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
