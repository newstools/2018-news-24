Police spokesperson, lieutenant colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, said the men, aged between 26 and 46, were arrested during a joint sting operation by the Namakgale SAPS, the Crime Intelligence Unit and the National Rhino 09 Unit, after a tip off that illegal explosives were being stored in a house within the Mashishimale village. He said it was believed the explosives could have been used to blow open safes, or in cash in transit heists, but said ongoing investigations would determine that. "The origin of these explosives is still being determined although it is believed that this might be part of a bigger syndicate involved in business and armed robberies," he said. Ngoepe said more arrests were expected to be made and that the three men were expected to appear before the Namakgale Magistrate's Court soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
