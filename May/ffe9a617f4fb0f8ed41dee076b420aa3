Pupils were treated to a practical lesson where they were taught about various symbols in the African culture and then shown how to paint these symbols on fabric. Each child who attended the event was given a pattern which they painted over and then applied onto the fabrics supplied to make a design of their choice. After the fabric workshop, pupils were treated to a storytelling session hosted by famous storyteller and poet, Gcina Mhlophe. Mhlophe took the pupils and those in attendance on a magical journey through the history and cultures of Africa through her reading, both informing and entertaining the crowd. “My story today was to focus on the African continent as a whole. There is so much diversity in our cultures,” said Mhlophe. Mhlophe stated that it is good to celebrate our cultures, but we must also learn and appreciate the cultures of others. “All these African cultures are separated by the borders that the coloniser put up, but we as people must not separate ourselves. We must learn about one another so that we can appreciate one another,” said Mhlophe.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
