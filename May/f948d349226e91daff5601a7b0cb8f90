Chamisa told News24 that he had a "fruitful" discussion with Johnson. "I have just had a great meeting with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Zimbabwe-UK relations on a fantastic path. The future is bright," said Chamisa. Chamisa urged the Theresa May government to reconsider its planned new policy on Zimbabwe, saying that the new policy should come into effect after a "successful free and fair election". In recent months, Britain has focused more on re-engagement to promote business and stabilise the Zimbabwe's economy. However, Chamisa said that the southern African country's former colonisers were making a "mistake" on Zimbabwe by assisting President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government before it had implemented electoral and economic reforms. Earlier this year, Johnson expressed optimism over Zimbabwe's political future but urged Mnangagwa's government to deliver "a free and fair election".
