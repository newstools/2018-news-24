Mohlaloga was found guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in January. The court found that he had defrauded the Land Bank of about R6m in 2008. He acted with at least three other accomplices to transfer the money from the Land Bank to an attorney's trust fund. Following the judgment, the committee initially resolved to recommend to the National Assembly that Mohlaloga be removed from the Icasa council. However, it referred the matter back to the committee after Mohlaloga indicated that he intended to appeal the conviction. "The recommendation is in line with Section 8 of the Icasa Act and is made following a guilty judgment against Mr Mohlaloga on charges of fraud and money laundering by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court," chairperson of the committee Humphrey Maxegwana said. Mohlaloga was appointed chairperson in December 2017. Fin24 previously reported that Mohlaloga was appointed to the previous Icasa board in 2013, despite the fraud allegations and had served as acting chair since 2016.
