suffers from a skin disease that first surfaced last year as he and other
military commanders planned Operation Restore Legacy, the army takeover that
preceded Robert Mugabe’s resignation. Chiwenga, the former defence forces chief, dismissed claims
that his lighter complexion and the pale patches visible on his hands are a
result of him using skin lightening creams. Whole body affected "It was during (the military operation) that I fell ill. I
had this skin disease that affected my whole body from beneath my feet to my
back and the journalists started saying I was using skin lightening creams but
that was not the case. I was sick," he said in quotes and a video clip carried
by the state-run Chronicle. "We then sent everything to South Africa to find out
what was causing the sickness but they failed to treat it," he added. Nun supplied herbs Chiwenga, who was speaking at the funeral of his sister in
the eastern town of Marondera on Tuesday, said he had since been healed with
herbs supplied by a Roman Catholic nun. The private NewsDay said Chiwenga – who is married to a
former Zimbabwean model – had recently been derided on social media with names
like "Bleachy Chiwenga" and "General Ambi" – after the famous make of skin
cream. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
