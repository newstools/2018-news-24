The work was completed on Saturday 19 May. Ward councillor Ian Iversen says the work was done with funds from the local budget at a cost of R113 000. According to him, the project was carried out using Extended Public Works Programme (EPWP) workers for cleaning jobs. He says it is hoped that the upgrade will improve the economy in the suburbs. “I am sure that this upgrading will be good for business in the area. The balance of Mains Avenue to Tennant Road has been resurfaced and looks really good, hopefully for the next 10 years. The funding for this project came from my ward allocation budget of 2017/2018.” The pavement on the mountain side of Main Road has been brick paved to match up with the pavement moving towards Wynberg on the opposite side of Main Road. Iversen says the cost of brick paving is virtually on a par with tarring the surface­. He says the upgrade was done following the discovery that the existing pavement “had a number of ‘dips’ and raised and washed-away areas. It was becoming dangerous to pedestrians.” He says as this is expected to bring about positive results in the community, he would like to urge residents and business owners to do their part by looking after the plants in the large pots. “Some [residents and business owners] are already doing so and a few of the large pots will be repainted to fit into the area on a coordinated colour basis,” says Iversen. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
