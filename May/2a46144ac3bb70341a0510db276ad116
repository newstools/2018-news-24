The pair was granted leave to appeal in February, after the High Court sitting in the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court dismissed their application for leave to appeal in October 2017. Jackson and Oosthuizen – the men who forced Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin – were sentenced to 11 years and 14 years behind bars respectively. As she handed down the sentences, Judge Segopotje Mphahlele said the men's conduct was "humiliating and disgusting". They had forced Mlotshwa into a coffin and threatened to pour petrol on him. The incident was filmed and the video went viral on social media, sparking an outcry and demands for justice. Mphahlele said their conduct had gone against the spirit of the Constitution. The men were convicted of assault, attempted murder, kidnapping and intimidation. The SCA matter will be heard by Judges of Appeal Mahomed Navsa and Nigel Willis, and Acting Judge of Appeal Ashton Schippers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
