In August 2014 Sbusiso Mkhize was at his family home in Umgababa when his uncle, Reginald Mkhize, reprimanded him for using drugs. "The accused left his room and returned with a knife and stabbed his uncle. Reginald tried getting away from his nephew but he followed him into the yard, sat on top of him and fatally stabbed him," police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said. A case of murder was opened at the Amanzimtoti police station. "On 12 December 2014, the members proceeded to Amanzimtoti CBD where the suspect was hiding and arrested him for murder," Gwala said. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended police officers for tracing and arresting the suspect. "No one can escape the long arm of the law. Our police will continue to work tirelessly to put criminals behind bars where they belong. We are pleased with the sentence handed over to the accused," he said.
