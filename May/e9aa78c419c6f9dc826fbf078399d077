Mthembu was elected at the region's 7th regional congress held on Saturday at the Meander Manor Hotel in Salt Rock, on the province's north coast. Sipho Mkhize, from the office of the regional chair, said the region - which is the sixth largest region in KZN – concluded the election of its officials. The election was presided over by Elexion, an independent elections body, and overseen by members of the NEC, KZN Provincial Task Team and observers as prescribed by the ANC constitution, Mkhize explained in a statement. Mthembu said he was happy and accepted the task. "Our mission from now on is to improve people's lives and ensure better and improved service delivery within the region," he said. Mthembu said he was also pleased with the levels of discipline portrayed by all delegates and cadres who stood for all positions. "Most of all I am happy that in an unprecedented move the conference elected two youth persons into the top five of the REC, this shows our seriousness to recognise the ability of young people," he said. The conference also elected Khonzuyise Ngidi as Mthembu's deputy, Musa Zondi as secretary, Matozi Khuzwayo-Dlamini as deputy secretary and Thulani Ntuli as treasurer. Ngidi is the former regional chairperson of ANC Youth League and Zondi is the current secretary of the league. "Their election into the regional executive committee (REC) marks a significant point to the resolutions of the 9th Provincial ANCYL Congress, which resolved that young people must assume ranks in the mother-body," said the statement.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
