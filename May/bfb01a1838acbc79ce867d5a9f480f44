Frank Nwaru was held in custody after making a brief appearance in the Klerksdorp Magistrate's Court on Monday, Hawks spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said. Nwaru was arrested by the Hawks' Narcotics Enforcement Bureau after a tip-off of alleged drug dealing near a primary school. "The suspect was spotted leaving his apartment and when he noticed that he was being followed, he allegedly threw a black plastic bag inside his vehicle and attempted to run away. The suspect was immediately overpowered and detained whilst his vehicle was searched, revealing the contents of the plastic bag to be drugs."
