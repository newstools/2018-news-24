dead. It's not clear whether the motive for the murder of Nkosikhona
Maxhakaza was political. The ANC's Harry Gwala Region Secretary Sindi Msomi said the
incident happened on Saturday night. "We heard that he was getting to his home and he was
shot nearby his home," Msomi said. "No one has been arrested." She said that Maxhakaza used to be an active ANC member but
had not been so for some time, since he began working as a community
development worker. As a result, the party was "not sure" whether he
had been targeted for political reasons. Comment from the police was not immediately available. There have been a spate of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal
recently, with President Cyril Ramaphosa calling for an end to the violence. He said the ANC leadership was particularly concerned with
the number of deaths in the Moses Mabhida region, where 14 people have been
