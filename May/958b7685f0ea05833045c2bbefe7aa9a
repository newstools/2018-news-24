central Zimbabwe know what it's like to live without water: their Day Zero
happened 20 years ago. Many taps in the mining and farming town, around two hours'
drive south-west of Harare, are redundant and residents say their children are
leaving school without ever using a shower. Man-made crisis "Water is a major challenge in Kadoma (and) in some areas
residents have not received the precious liquid from their taps for more than
20 years now," Wikirosi Mutizira, chairperson of the local residents’ association,
told the state-run Herald. Unlike Cape Town, Kadoma's water woes, as with many cities
in Zimbabwe, are man-made. Infrastructure hasn't been maintained or upgraded to
cater for the growth of the town’s population. Taps are of no use Many residents have to use water from open sources, or
boreholes that were sunk by donors during the cholera epidemic that swept
through Zimbabwe a decade ago. "I have children who are almost completing their secondary
school who have never used a shower in their lifetime and it’s such a
pity," said Tichaona Masero, of Kadoma's Rimuka suburb. "I have since
removed outside taps as they are of no use because they risk being stolen,” he
told the paper. Health risk Annastancia Nduku of the town’s Westview suburb said
residents use the bush and nearby maize fields as a lavatory, raising health
risks. Some suburbs in the capital Harare have also gone for years
without water, and the nearby town of Chitungwiza is currently fighting a
cholera outbreak blamed on the lack of clean water supplies. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
