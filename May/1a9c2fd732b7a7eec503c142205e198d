beloved dog had to be put down. A week after his dog Tilly died, Seb Morris (14) took his
own life. “He said it was too soon, and we didn't give her enough of a
chance to get better,” read a statement which was recently released by his mom,
Claire, after a long post-mortem examination. It was written after the 14-year-old hung himself in his
bedroom in his home in Taunton, in the English county of Somerset. The incident
happened in November 2017, but the post mortem results have only recently been released. News that the teenager had tried to take his life by
overdosing on pills on two separate occasions, less than a year before his
death, also sent shockwaves through the community. Seb was a popular and “much
loved” boy, said his mom in her statement. The statement also included a part
of the post-mortem results. According to the coroner, Tony Williams, the cause of Seb's
death was hanging – but he couldn’t provide any other evidence with regard to
his intentions. Seb, who was a budding boxer, got Tilly when he was
four-years-old. “She was his best friend, he spent a lot of time with her,” said
Claire. In the written statement she said it was possibly the reason he took
his life. She revealed she wasn’t concerned about his mental wellbeing in the
time before his death. “He seemed okay, there was nothing out of the ordinary,”
she said of the hours before his death on 18 November last year. That was the day she found his body in his bedroom. Sources: mirror.co.uk,
