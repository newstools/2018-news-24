Nokuthula Khanyile MORE than a year after falling victim to sim swap fraudsters, a Pietermaritzburg resident is still suffering the consequences. Mbalenhle Nsuntsha from Edendale lost R11 300 due to the fraud after the sim card in her cell phone was hacked. Nsuntsha told The Witness (Echo’s sister paper) how soon after her cellphone sim card had stopped working and she was persuaded to do a sim swap she’d watched in horror as message after message appeared on her phone indicating that numerous transactions — varying from R1 000 to R5 000 each — were being paid out of her account. According to her, the ordeal started after she lost network coverage soon after receiving a phone call from someone who masqueraded as a Cell C call centre agent. Nsuntsha toldThe Witness that the bogus agent told her that the mobile network had received a request for a sim swap from her cellphone number. A few hours after the call, she was unable to make or receive calls or SMSs. “At first I suspected that it might be a scam but the woman on the line sounded very professional and I was convinced that she really worked for Cell C.” Although Nsuntsha said that she had declined to have the sim swap done, she said that the “agent” informed her that the mobile network would block her number because the request had already been logged. “I eventually gave in and we proceeded to do the sim swap. She [the agent] didn’t ask any suspicious security questions about my bank account; neither did she request my bank pin. She only asked me to provide her with three separate passwords to process the sim swap.” Thereafter, Nsuntsha said, she received numerous SMSs, which were purportedly from Cell C, confirming that she had done a sim swap. “After receiving those notifications I lost network coverage for three hours.” The resident said that when she switched the phone on again, she received SMSs. “Many of them were from my bank and I realised that money had been deducted from my account, without me being aware of it.” Nsuntsha said that, the following day, she went to Capitec and the matter was reported to the bank’s forensic section, which identified that fraud had been committed. A summary of her banking details shows all the transactions and numerous purchases of prepaid airtime and electricity vouchers.  A beneficiary was created on her account and a total of five transactions were made, transferring money from her account to the beneficiary, until the limit on her cheque account was reached.                  HOW DO FRAUSTERS GAIN ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT? ACCORDING to Capitec, there are various ways in which fraudsters can obtain the confidential cell phone login information required to access a bank client’s account using the mobile banking platform. A common theme in such cases is that the fraudster obtains the confidential cellphone banking access information directly from the banking client. Capitec says that this fraud involves fraudulent SMSs sent to bank clients in an effort to obtain the client’s confidential banking credentials from them. The SMSs used by the fraudsters often seem genuine, as the content of the SMS implies that it was sent from a legitimate financial institution. This SMS is usually followed up by a phone call from the fraudsters — usually from a private number. The purpose of the phone call is to trick the client into divulging their personal details such as the mobile banking PIN. The fraudsters often utilise confidential and private information about the client to convince them that the phone call is in fact legitimate. The fraudster can obtain this information by various legal or illegal methods from various sources, which may have nothing to do with the bank.
