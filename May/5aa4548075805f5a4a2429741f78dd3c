Lawyer Senoussi Ali Abdoulaye tells Chadian National Radio the vote means more power will be concentrated in the hands of President Idriss Deby, who has been in office since 1990. Opposition members and civil society groups demonstrated against the new constitution, which was approved in a 132-2 vote on Monday. It abolishes the constitutional council and high court of justice and introduces a six-year presidential term, replacing the current five-year one. It also re-imposes a two-term limit that will not be retroactively applied, meaning that Deby can serve two more terms after 2021 elections. Deby must sign off on the parliament vote. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
