The man allegedly lured her out of her home using threatening WhatsApp messages before unexpectedly pulling the gun on her. During his shooting frenzy, the ex-husband shot the mother of four through her neck. She is thought to be quadriplegic and might have to spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair. The 32-year-old's former partner is now on the run but sent his victim a bizarre audio clip saying: "It cannot be justified what I did, sorry. "I cannot say anything else, get better. Take care, I know you will hate me, but I would like to see you [get] better ... because you are an intelligent person. "Well, you are half mad and do weird things, but in this moment, you are smarter than me." It’s unclear why the couple split but it’s believed their breakup is what fuelled the man’s shooting rampage. The victim’s brother, Andres Poveda told local media that his sister’s phone had multiple texts from her ex-husband. "In my sister’s mobile phone there are some WhatsApp messages where he is saying 'go outside b*tch' and when my sister went out, he shot her in the stomach and neck." The fugitive is reportedly fleeing to the Chocó Department, in western Colombia, where he is originally from. Relatives have tried to make a report to the prosecution, but the authorities say it’s the victim who needs to lodge the case. However, since she’s still in hospital, they are reportedly waiting for the authorities to interview her so the investigation can start.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
