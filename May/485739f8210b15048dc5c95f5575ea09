vulnerable migrants from Libya to Niger, the first group to be flown out after
a two-month halt in such evacuations. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says the group of refugees
and asylum-seekers was flown from Tripoli to Niger's capital, Niamey, on
Thursday. UNHCR's humanitarian evacuation program had been halted in early
March amid concerns from Niger's government that migrants were arriving there
faster than previous arrivals could be resettled elsewhere. UNHCR tried to fly out the migrants on Tuesday but the flight had
to turn back to Tripoli because of technical problems. The UN has been trying to empty government-controlled detention centres
in Libya as part of a stepped-up effort to tackle the smuggling and slavery of
migrants. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE
