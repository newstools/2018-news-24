days after her arm was bitten off in a crocodile attack near Victoria Falls, a
newspaper reported on Sunday. Zanele Ndlovu, a former national tennis player, married
Jamie Fox on Saturday in a chapel at Bulawayo's Mater Dei hospital where she
was treated for her injuries, reports the Sunday News. "This has never happened before and it is quite exciting.
You can tell people are all excited about this," a hospital staffer told the
paper. Lucky to be alive Pictures from the chapel service show Ndlovu in a wedding
dress, with the stump of her right arm in bandages. Her husband is pictured
putting a ring on her left hand, which is also partially bandaged, and she is
also seen signing a marriage certificate. A short video clip from the ceremony shows the moment the
groom kisses the bride. Watch the video below Ndlovu and Fox were in an inflatable boat in the Zambezi
River above the Victoria Falls when they were attacked by the crocodile last
week. "During the attack the crocodile gripped her arm and ripped
it off while her partner made frantic efforts to save her. They are lucky to be
alive though," an unnamed family member told the paper. Out of all animals, crocodiles were behind the biggest
number of fatal attacks on humans in Zimbabwe last year, with 21 killed by the
reptiles between January and December, according to a Chronicle report. On New Year’s Eve a 90-year-old man was killed and another
woman seriously injured when their inflatable boat was attacked by crocodiles
in a dam at the Matopos National Park. And last month a Zambian tourist lost his arm after he
jumped into a crocodile pool at a pub in Victoria Falls town, another Chronicle report said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
