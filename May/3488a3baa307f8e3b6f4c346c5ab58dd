Dr Serge Ngalebato, Bikoro Hospital director, tells The Associated Press that two nurses who were in contact with patients are among the five suspected cases. Already two Ebola cases have been confirmed in the region. Ngalebato says that among the new suspected cases is a woman from Ikoko Impenge, the epicenter of the outbreak some 30km from Bikoro. He says the new patients have been isolated. Health officials are trying to stabilise them as they show signs of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and intense fatigue. This is the ninth Ebola outbreak in DRC since 1976. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
