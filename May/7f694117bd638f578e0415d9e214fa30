Kobus and Louisa Koekemoer also received 10 years each on two counts of child abuse. Judge Bert Bam said in his view, perpetrators of child abuse should be removed from society for a very long time. He said that in the case of Poppie, the Koekemoers were inherently evil seeing as they abused her for eight months before she died.  He also found that they were not remorseful, and only expressed regret when they were caught and convicted.

The incidents took place between September 2015 and October 2016 in various locations. The couple was arrested after Poppie died near Brits in October 2016. Bam found that, although much of the evidence was circumstantial, it should be viewed as a "mosaic". He added that both accused had a duty to protect the children, but had ended up blaming each other for the abuse of the children, indicating that they were both aware of what was happening.
