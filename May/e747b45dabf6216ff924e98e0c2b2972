Due to come into force on Saturday, the law would compel bloggers to pay $900 for a permit, a huge sum in the poor East African country. Failure to comply could lead to a $2 200 fine or jail time. The court, sitting in the southern coastal town of Mtwara, ordered a suspension of the law pending the outcome of a legal challenge by Tanzanian human rights groups and media. The court order "restrained" the government from "enforcing the deadline... in respect of the registration of bloggers, online forums, radios and televisions," a statement said. The law, signed in mid-March, was widely criticised as a further attempt by President John Magufuli to gag dissent. The next hearing in the case is next Thursday. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
