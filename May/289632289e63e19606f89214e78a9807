often have it tough dealing with difficult customers, but this woman took “I want
to see the manager” a bit too far! A woman who wanted to use the bathroom at a
Tim Hortons coffee shop in Langley, Canada, became furious when she was denied
access due to her “past
behaviour”. In fact, she became so enraged she decided to poo on the floor
in the middle of the coffee shop, bending down afterwards to grab her own
faeces and throw it at a staff member. According to BuzzFeedNews,
a spokesperson for Tim Hortons said that they have a "restricted access
policy for restrooms to ensure the well-being of their guests". The staff member reported the woman to the
authorities who confirmed that they have "dealt with her before”. Watch the video here:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
