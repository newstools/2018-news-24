Local news sites reported earlier that sources claim Henri was admitted to a hospital after trying to commit suicide in Pollsmoor prison. The 23-year-old has kept in the prison’s hospital ward after he was found guilty of three counts of murder, a charge of attempted murder and justice on Monday, 21 May. In January 2015, Henri’s parents Martin and Teresa, and older brother Rudi were found axed to death at their home at De Zalze golf estate outside Stellenbosch. His sister, Marli, suffered serious injuries in the brutal attack. Henri's uncle on his father's side, André van Breda, confirmed to YOU today that Henri was not seriously injured. "A senior source from the Cape confirmed it to me." Henri did however sustain some injury, but it is unconfirmed how it came about. "He had a small scratch, but that is all," André added, but could not elaborate on the alleged incident. Henri's attorney, Lorinda van Niekerk, told YOU she had not been informed that Henri had been admitted to an external hospital. According to her, a medical certificate was submitted to the court last week and Henri is still being held in Pollsmoor's hospital wing. Henri's sentencing starts on Tuesday, 5 June. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
