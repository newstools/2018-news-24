EMPD spokesperson Chief Clifford Shongwe said a reliable source had led them to the house on Monday evening where they found a couple with "a lot of money in their possession" that made them suspicious. "They then led us to a hole which they dug to hide a trunk full of undisclosed cash." There have been social media reports that the money recovered was R1.5m, however, Shonge could not confirm this. "I don't want to speculate on the amount. For now, we will say an undisclosed amount."

He said the 40-year-old woman was allegedly the girlfriend of a SBV employee who was arrested in Germiston on May 7, on suspicion of stealing money.
