Security official Ali Mohamed tells The Associated Press that the bomber, thought to be with the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab extremist group, detonated a suicide vest in the market in Wanlaweyn, 90km south of Mogadishu. Fifteen other people were wounded in the attack. Mohamed says most of the victims are civilians. There is no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast but the Somalia-based al-Shabaab has carried out similar attacks in the region. Despite being ousted from most of its key strongholds in the Horn of Africa nation, the extremist group continues to carry out attacks across large parts of southern and central Somalia. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
