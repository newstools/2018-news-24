UPDATE: Following the incident, the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Safety Association of SA (LPGSASA) informed News24 that the incident did not involve an LP Gas cylinder. "After talking to the safety officer at the Kwadukuza fire station, it transpired that the fire was not caused by a LPGas cylinder but rather by petrol.  Had the LPGSASA been contacted regarding this, we believe we would have been able to offer some perspective to this as an LPGas cylinder cannot simply 'explode'. If a cylinder was to rupture in could only be through sufficient exposure to intense heat being applied to the cylinder," the association said.
