Jenna Etheridge The bodies of two men were retrieved from a cave near Vlakplaas, west of Pretoria on Tuesday, police said. The owner of the property where the cave is located, alerted police officers on Monday afternoon. This led to an operation to extricate them, said Captain Augustinah Selepe. "Allegations that the two deceased are members of the Zion Christian Church cannot be confirmed, pending identification of the deceased," she said. Anyone who may have information that could assist with the identification of the men, or help establish what led to their death, can contact the police on 08600 10111 or report to their nearest police station. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
