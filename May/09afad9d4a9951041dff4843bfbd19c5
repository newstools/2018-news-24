African Parks, a Johannesburg-based conservation group, said on Thursday that the rhinos will travel by air to Zakouma National Park, a reserve in Chad that it manages with the government. The group says the goal is to help the long-term survival of black rhinos and to restore biodiversity in Chad. It says there are fewer than 25 000 rhinos in the African wild, of which about 20% are black rhinos and the rest white rhinos. Most of the rhinos are in South Africa, though the population has been hit hard by poachers supplying horns to an illegal Asian market.  * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
