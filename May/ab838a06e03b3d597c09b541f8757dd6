The Health Ministry said on Tuesday that five samples were taken from suspected cases in Bikoro in the northwest. It said of the five samples sent to the National Institute of Biological Research in Kinshasa, two came back positive for Ebola. It said since the notification of the cases on May 3, no deaths have been reported among those hospitalised or among health personnel. The ministry said a team of experts will go to Bikoro on Wednesday to supervise and help monitor the situation to avoid further spread of the disease. This is the ninth outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in DRC since 1976. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
