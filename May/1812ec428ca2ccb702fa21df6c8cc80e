According to reports, it was a magnitude 2.2 earthquake. Eight miners remain underground, the company said. Three have been located but five are missing. Cosatu said it was "alarmed by the deteriorating and poor safety record of Sibanye Stillwater mining company". In February, nearly 1 000 miners were trapped underground for 30 hours following a power cut caused by a storm in another mine owned by Sibanye-Stillwater. A few days later, two miners were killed after ground collapsed at a mine also belonging to the group.
