The overnight attack on the Niambalang bridge near the Casamance capital Zinguinchor was the first on the bridge since 1998. "Armed men tried to blow up the bridge with explosives" but failed, a military source told AFP. They torched the huts of eight fishermen living underneath the bridge, killing one, the source said. A relative of the fisherman confirmed this. The bridge links Zinguinchor to the beach resort of Cap Skirring, which is popular with Western tourists. Tensions have mounted in Casamance following the massacre of 14 young men in execution-style killings in a protected forest on January 6. The bloodbath caused some to blame a group that has led a 35-year armed campaign for the region's independence. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
