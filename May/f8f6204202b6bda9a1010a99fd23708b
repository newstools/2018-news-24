According to News.com he broke the record in 2016 when he ate 28 788 burgers. And he’s now eaten his 30 000th Big Mac! Don, who’s also known as “Big Mac Daddy”, told the New York Post he’s eaten two Big Macs every day for the past 46 years. Starting on 17 May 1972, the retired prison guard has eaten at least one burger a day and even kept the receipts for his purchases. Hamburgers account for 90% of his diet, Fox News reports. The former prison warden recently retired and says all he wants to do now is eat Big Macs. “I love the patties, the sauce – I can’t get enough of it.” According to Daily Mail, his goal is to eat 40 000 burgers. “But it’s going to take me another 14 years to achieve that,” Don says.  He also shot back at those asking how his diet has affected his health. “I weigh 87 kg and am completely healthy,” he told the New York Post.
