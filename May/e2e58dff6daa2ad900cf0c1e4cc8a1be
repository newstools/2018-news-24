Spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk said an arson case was registered and an inquest opened on Monday after the fire razed the structures in Idada Avenue in Taiwan informal settlement in the early hours of Monday. The bodies of three adults aged 60, 31, and 27, and five children aged 14, nine, seven, six, and two, were found after the fire was extinguished. He told News24 on Tuesday morning that the 21-year-old was only being questioned at this stage. In the meantime, one man burnt to death in a fire in his home in Moerat Road, Gugulethu on Monday night. City of Cape Town fire and rescue spokesperson Theo Layne said that the fire was contained and that no other structures were affected. Further afield, Working on Fire spokesperson Lauren Howard said at least 40 firefighters were on the fire line at SA National Parks' Goudveld on the Garden Route. She implored people to clear their properties of overhead branches and their gutters of leaves to prevent wild fires from spreading. She also reiterated that people must be cautious when using candles and paraffin in their homes during winter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
