Analysts say it is leaving local youth susceptible for recruitment to the al-Qaeda-linked group. Dozens of teachers have been sleeping in a union boardroom for weeks as they protest the lack of security and face tear gas from police. At least 224 primary schools and 42 secondary schools in Wajir County can no longer function after non-local teachers fled. The exodus was caused by the February 16 al-Shabaab attack on a primary school in which two non-Muslim teachers were killed. Kenya's Teachers Service Commission transferred 329 teachers elsewhere for their safety. Many others left on their own. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
