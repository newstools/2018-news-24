In a statement, the Transportation Ministry said the new fare will go into effect on Friday. It also said prices will now be affected by the number of stations commuters travel. For example, a round trip of more than 16 stations would cost $0.79. The ministry said that revenues will be used to improve the quality of the service provided to millions of Egyptians, adding that maintenance deficits have reached 94%.
