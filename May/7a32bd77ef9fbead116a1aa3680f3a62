provided conclusive evidence that there are no hidden rooms inside King
Tutankhamun's burial chamber. The
Sunday statement by Mostafa Waziri, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of
Antiquities, says an Italian team conducted extensive studies with
ground-penetrating radar that showed the tomb did not contain any hidden,
man-made blocking walls as was earlier suspected. Francesco Porcelli of the
Polytechnic University of Turin will present the findings later on Sunday. In
2015, British Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves proposed, after analysis of
high-definition laser scans, that queen Nefertiti's tomb could be concealed
behind wall paintings in the famed boy king's burial chamber. The
ministry says previous scans by Japanese and American scientists had proved
inconclusive. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your
