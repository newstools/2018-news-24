According to Steenberg police spokesperson, Warrant Officer John Bartlett, members of the National Intervention Unit (NIU) were briefed about a hijacked vehicle in the Retreat area during their morning patrols and the unit spotted a silver Audi and black Hyundai Tuscon. “They chased the vehicles which sped off in the direction of Grassy Park. The officers observed one of the suspects pointing a firearm at them. The officers retaliated with fire and the cars were forced to a standstill at the corners of Fifth Avenue and Prince George Drive in Grassy Park,” says Bartlett. Five men, aged between 24 and 36, were arrested and a firearm seized. “One of the suspects sustained a gunshot wound to his shoulder. The Tucson was reportedly hijacked in the Kleinvlei policing precinct. The Audi was not reported as stolen,” Bartlett adds.
