More than 200 people came out to participate in the event and the launch of the W2W Sasha-Lee Search and Rescue (W2WSAR) campaign on the day (“Locals to hold night vigil,” People’s Post, 24 April). The launch included guest speakers from several organisations, song and dance activities and the serving of supper to the community­. “Finally, after three years since Shasha-Lee’s disappearance – a girl who was never found – we at least have something to celebrate. We officially launched the Sasha-Lee Search and Rescue Team that will specialise in the field of missing persons and human trafficking, not just in Hanover Park, but all neighbouring communities as well,” says Yaseen Johaar. “W2W would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every individual who participated in making this event a success,” adds Johaar. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
