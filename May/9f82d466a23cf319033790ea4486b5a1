"Reports suggest that upon arrival inside the flat, they were attacked by a group of men who allegedly robbed them of cash and cellphones. While the friend managed to escape, the victim was pushed through the window and he fell to the ground." 'Internet crimes' Police have launched a manhunt for the perpetrators and a case of murder and robbery is being investigated. "Sunnyside police are searching for a man known as 'Ekene'. It is believed that he might be able to assist them with the investigations," Mavimbela said.
