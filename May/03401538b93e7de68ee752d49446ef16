The meteorological authority said late on Monday that winds blowing up sand and dust are affecting visibility. It says the unstable weather is expected to last until on Thursday. Authorities closed several highways in Upper Egypt and in the New Valley province due to lack of visibility, according to the state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram. Visuals obtained by The Associated Press show a sandstorm rolling in over the southern city of Aswan on Monday. Rare heavy rainfall has pummeled Cairo and other parts of the country last week, leaving some roads impassable. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
