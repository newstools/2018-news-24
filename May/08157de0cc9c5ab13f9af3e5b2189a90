Chizoba Uba, 36, was arrested on Tuesday for human trafficking after he allegedly lured the woman from Johannesburg to Cape Town in January. On her arrival, the woman was met by the alleged suspect and kept against her will in Park Villas, Bellville, Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase said. "The matter was reported to the Hawks for investigation after the victim approached a law enforcement officer in Bellville and asked for assistance," he said. "The victim was put in a place of safety and further investigation by the Hawks eventually secured the identity and arrest of the suspect." Nkwalase said that more arrests were imminent. Uba is expected to appear again in court on July 2. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
