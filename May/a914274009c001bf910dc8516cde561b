According to police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi the teenage boy is doing well. “The boy is well and wasn’t harmed,” Hlathi said. Katlego Marite went missing on the afternoon of Sunday 20 May while playing with two friends in Frangipani Street, Tasbetpark Extension 3, Witbank. A ransom note had later been left at his family’s home demanding the family pay a ransom of “15 Bitcoin (about R1,5 million), not in rands” to secure Katlego’s release. The note also instructed the family not to involve the police. Hlathi couldn’t give further details about how he was found.

Neighbours are also flocking in to confirm the good news. Katlego’s friends who were with him when he was abducted on Sunday jumped with joy when they heard that their friend is alive. “Yes, God is good,” one boy said, clapping and smiling.  His parents are said to still be at the police station with him. It’s believed that he’s unharmed but still a bit shaken.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
