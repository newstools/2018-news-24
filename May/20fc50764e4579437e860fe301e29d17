young comedian who was working for a popular satirical television program. Azza
Soliman told The Associated Press on Monday that plainclothes policemen raided
Shady Abu Zaid's house in a Cairo neighbourhood early on Sunday and arrested
him. She says Abu Zaid's whereabouts are unknown. His
sister, Roula Abu Zaid, has confirmed the arrest in a Facebook post. Abu
Zaid was working as correspondent for a recently cancelled satirical program,
hosted by a puppet named Abla Fahita. Now he produces a show, The Rich Content,
which is shared on social media networks. In

police officers on the fifth anniversary of the 2011 uprising that toppled
former President Hosni Mubarak. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your
