said on Sunday. The boy drowned on Saturday afternoon. "The boy…allegedly played with other children near the
local sewer dam and landed in the dam and drowned," the organisation's
spokesperson Billy J Claasen said. Residents of the area allege that there were holes in the
fence to the dam – an issue that the organisation said needed to be
investigated. The boy’s mother had died in 2014 and he was currently
living with a foster mother. "The community are full or grief and support the
devastated mother," said Claasen.  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
