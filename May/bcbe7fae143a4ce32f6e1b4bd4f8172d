WATCH: 7-months pregnant woman assaulted over parking spot Theron said that while she could not comment on the incident because it may prejudice legal proceedings, the company has launched an internal investigation. "Novare has launched an investigation into the matter that will be led by two non-executive Novare directors and one of South Africa's leading legal firms." Fourie said last week that after the incident, which took place at a fast food chain in Krugersdorp, she was "taking strain" and her doctor was conducting regular check-ups on her unborn baby.
