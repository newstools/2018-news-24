WATCH Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille says the Democratic Alliance has forced her to seek relief from the courts. This after the party confirmed the cessation of her membership of the DA on Tuesday morning, after charging the embattled mayor with misconduct earlier this year. The DA cited clause 3.5.1.2 in its constitution, which says if a member publicly declares his or her intention to resign, then their membership ceases immediately. De Lille reportedly said during a radio interview on April 26 that she would "walk away from the party" once she had cleared her name, as the "the writing's on the wall" that people didn't want her to be there.

"Despite this mockery of fairness and justice, the thousands of supporters from all over the country have sent so many messages of support over the eight months that I've endured this relentless onslaught by these bullies against me," said De Lille.
