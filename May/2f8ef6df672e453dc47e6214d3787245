According to eNCA, Auxillia said that she was leaving PAP with "a heavy heart". The first lady said goodbye to the 255-member institution on Monday during the 6th ordinary session of the 4th PAP in Midrand. A Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) report quoted her as saying that the PAP needed to be transformed from being a consultative entity into a fully-fledged parliament. "It is my considered view that by now all of you are acquainted with the events that took place in the Republic of Zimbabwe, leading to the assumption of office of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe by my husband, His Excellency, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa on November 24 November 2017. As a result of this development, I am now laden with various responsibilities that come with being the First Lady of the republic," Auxillia was quoted as saying. The first lady has served the continental organisation as chairperson of the Southern African Regional Caucus, the report said. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
