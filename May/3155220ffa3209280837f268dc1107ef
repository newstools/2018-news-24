commercially-produced crops. Factories closed "The $16.9 billion-worth of production lost would
only be the start (and) Zimbabwe became a net importer… from 1998 as most of
the food-processing companies reduced output, then closed down when commercial
farming suppliers went down," he said. "Non-food agricultural declines such as cotton and timber
production also caused the failure of most textile, clothing and paper-making
