The City's law enforcement spokesperson, Wayne Dyason, said protesters once again targeted private property. "A bottle store at the second traffic circle on Baden Powell Drive in the Capricorn Village residential area was petrol bombed. A restaurant was also petrol bombed and bricks were hurled through its windows while patrons were inside. All patrons [were] evacuated and no one [was] injured." Dyason said protesters dispersed when police and the City's law enforcement unit arrived on scene. "A heavy police presence will be maintained in the area." On Monday violence gripped the Vrygrond and Capricorn areas. Protesters torched a building and three vehicles. A man sustained minor burns and two women were allegedly roughed up by the crowd. On Sunday, a group of people attacked the City's coastal park landfill site adjacent to Vrygrond and two other businesses. It's understood the unrest began after shacks were destroyed by officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
