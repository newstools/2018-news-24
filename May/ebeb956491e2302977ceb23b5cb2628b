The suspect was arrested on Wednesday after the police discovered a half-naked man bleeding on the street in Rietvallei on February 18. "From what we heard from those who were there, the victim was chased and attacked by a group of people from the community after he was caught breaking into a home," police spokesperson Captain Solomon Sibiya told News24. "He sustained stab wounds to his back and head injuries. He was certified dead on the scene by the paramedics. Kagiso SAPS opened a murder case docket and launched an investigation into the matter."

Sibiya said residents had informed the police of the suspect's alleged involvement in the mob justice. "He is the only person we have arrested so far, but we are hoping that there will be more to come. We're hoping that the suspect will open up to us, because I'm sure he won't want to go down for this alone," Sibiya said. Station commander Colonel Mangolo Mabuso said that those who engaged in mob justice would face the "full might of the law". "We will continue educating and discouraging our communities about mob justice," he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
