has stoned to death a woman accused of marrying 11 men. The
al-Qaeda-linked group's radio arm Andalus reports that the stoning was carried
out on Wednesday after an ad hoc al-Shabaab court convicted the woman in
Sablale town in Lower Shabelle region. The
report says masked men stoned to death 30-year-old Shukri Abdullahi Warsame in
a public square. The
self-proclaimed judge said the woman had confessed to having secretly married
11 men in a row without seeking a divorce. Al-Shabaab
has been fighting for years to impose a strict version of Islam in the
long-chaotic Horn of Africa nation. The
group often executes suspected spies and people accused of adultery after
convictions that human rights groups say lack the proper judiciary process. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your
