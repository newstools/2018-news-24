KwaZulu-Natal and two others have been arrested for allegedly attempting to
assassinate the municipal speaker. The mayor and his co-accused, aged 36 and 38, are expected
to appear in the Estcourt Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said they were arrested in a
"pre-dawn raid" by the political task team with the assistance of the
National Intervention Unit (NIU). Mhlongo said this was after the team intercepted information
of a plot to allegedly assassinate the municipal speaker. "The three suspects – the mayor, a councillor and a
hitman – allegedly planned an assassination plot against the speaker, who is
alleged to be an obstacle in the awarding of a tender. "It is understood the speaker allegedly suspected undue
influence and possible corruption in the process." They are charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other
related charges.   KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
