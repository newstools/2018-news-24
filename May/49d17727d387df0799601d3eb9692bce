This was what two men apparently persuaded a 48-year-old man from Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape to do. Joram Nkiriho, 28, and Moses Orimutambira, 36, allegedly managed to convince the man to resign from his job and give them money for the "ancestors" to multiply. They appeared in the Uitenhage Magistrate's Court on Tuesday and the case was postponed. "The victim was promised almost R2m in return. This is after the victim read about the suspects wonders in a local newspaper," provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni said. The scam happened between April and May 2018. According to Feni, after several failed attempts to reach the two culprits, the man realised something was amiss and contacted the Port Elizabeth serious commercial crime unit. The unit arrested Nkiriho and Orimutambira on Thursday last week. "It is alleged Orimutambira operated in the Uitenhage and Dispatch areas and identified himself as 'David'. He allegedly utilised the number 073 488 2366 to lure his victims." Feni said none of the money had been recovered. Anyone with information was urged to contact Warrant Officer Leo Mbengashe on 072 580 2621.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
