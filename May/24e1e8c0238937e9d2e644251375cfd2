It is understood that some students as well as security guards, cleaners and gardeners, were fighting for workers to be insourced. In a letter to students and staff on Monday, vice-chancellor and principal Professor Mahlo Mokgalong, explained that the examinations that were meant to be written at 08:00, could not proceed. Planned academic programmes were also interrupted. "As a result of the disruption, I have, after consultation with the executive committee of senate, decided to postpone all the examinations scheduled for today... with a view to allowing management to discuss the concerns raised with the student representative council and organised labour," Mokgalong said in the notice. He apologised for the inconvenience and said management was committed to finding a swift resolution to the issues raised. The affected exams will be rescheduled and a date is yet to be announced. However, examination papers scheduled for Tuesday will continue as planned. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
