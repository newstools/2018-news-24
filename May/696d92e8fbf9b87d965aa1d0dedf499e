Watch.WATCH An attempted "land invasion" in Atlantis, north of Cape Town's city centre, was thwarted on Thursday, local ward councillor Barbara Rass confirmed. "It did happen, but it is under control," said Rass. She said a group of people attempted to set up home on a plot near the farms of Atlantis. Rass said she went past and saw that the the Anti-Land Invasion Unit was monitoring the situation. A similar attempt was made in April in Robinvale, she added, but that was also foiled. On that occasion, people erected tents and used red and white tape to mark out plots. Attempts to move onto vacant land to build structures are falling into the spotlight amid rising rentals and demands for affordable housing. Parliament is currently also working towards proposals on possible legal amendments towards the expropriation of land without compensation. In Hermanus, some of the residents of the suburb Zwelihle have threatened to start building on a large piece of land that was promised to them, after they lost patience. News24 reported previously that, in March alone, over a six-day period, City staff dealt with 65 land invasions and associated protest incidents.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
