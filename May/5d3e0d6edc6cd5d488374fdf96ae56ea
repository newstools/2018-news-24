"The appointment of Siya Kolisi to lead the Springbok rugby team against England is a wonderful achievement that makes us walk very tall. "It speaks to the hope we felt 24 years ago that we were developing a special society in which the cream would rise to the top regardless of colour or class. Dankie, ou Rassie, vir u baie wyse keuse. A rousing victory over the English in June will be icing on the cake. Mayibuye iAfrica!” said Tutu in a statement. According to a Sport24 report, Kolisi is the first black person to be named as a Springbok Test captain, ending 127 years of white skippers since the national team debuted. Controversy has reportedly shadowed the 26-year-old flanker's appointment to the prized position, with some on social media and in rugby circles seeing his position as a political appointment. The post-apartheid government and rugby bosses have battled to enforce racial transformation in a team that once barred black people. At least 50% of the team at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan will be black, after a deal was struck between the ruling African National Congress and rugby officials.
