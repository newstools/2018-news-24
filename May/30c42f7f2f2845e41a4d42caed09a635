Jacobus Oosthuizen, charged with the murder of Nicola Pienaar in January last year, appeared before Judge Gayaat Salie-Hlophe for a pre-trial conference. During proceedings, prosecutor Megan Blows told the court that the defence counsel had approached the State to determine if there was a possibility that an agreement could be reached. It would possibly be finalised before Oosthuizen's next pre-trial conference, his advocate Burger Brand said. READ: Pienaar murder case - media allowed in court The case was postponed to June 8. Oosthuizen, 32, faces 11 charges, including murder, motor vehicle theft, theft of a petrol card and fraud, for allegedly using the petrol card and four credit cards. Pienaar was reported missing by her mother Marlaine Pienaar-Vice in January last year. Oosthuizen was arrested in Port Elizabeth later that month, after he was found driving Pienaar's car, which was packed with clothes and other items. Oosthuizen allegedly took officers to his home in Paarl, where Pienaar's body was found buried under rubble.
