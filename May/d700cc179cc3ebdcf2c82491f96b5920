Sherif Gaber was in police custody on Saturday and set to be questioned by the prosecution on Sunday, Gamal Eid, head of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, told AFP. "He has been arrested and should be questioned tomorrow," Eid said. It was not immediately clear when Gaber was arrested. In late March, Gaber tweeted that "some Muslim lawyers" filed a complaint against him with the attorney general. "I'll probably get arrested in the next few days, but I don't want you to get mad," he wrote. Gaber was detained in 2013 for allegedly promoting atheism. Promoting atheism can be punished in Egypt under a law that bans "insults to religions". * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
