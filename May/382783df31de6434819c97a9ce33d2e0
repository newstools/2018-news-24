The incident took place after the OCRB men spotted the unnamed aide with a weapon in his car and gave chase, shooting him as arrived at his home in the Sudanese diplomatic compound, the sources said. Central African President Faustin-Archange Touadera went to the scene of the shooting to apologise for the shooting which appeared to be a "blunder" by the OCRB men. The city remained tense on Friday after at least 24 people died on Tuesday in attacks that targeted a church and a mosque. Around 170 people were also wounded, sparking fears that one of the world's most unstable countries would plunge once more into a bloody sectarian conflict. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
