The Antiquities Ministry said on Thursday that the temple, which dates back to the reign of Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, was found near the Siwa Oasis in the western desert. It includes the foundations of a large limestone building. Abdel-Aziz al-Dimeiry, head of the archaeological mission, said they found a five-meter long limestone painting bearing Greek inscriptions and decorated with the sun disc surrounded by cobras. He says the painting, which is believed to be part of the temple's entrance, was found in good condition and will undergo restoration. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
