Christina Pitt Residents of Ocean View, Cape Town, retaliated on Tuesday as the Red Ants evicted illegal occupiers from two premises. City of Cape Town Law Enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said that residents stoned law enforcement officials and burned tyres in the streets. "There is a large police presence in the area. It is calm at the moment, but the situation is still volatile," he said. The City's housing office staff in the area were escorted out of the area and the building was closed. A section of the Kommetjie Road leading into Ocean View has been closed. Violent housing protests also erupted in other communities, such as Parkwood and Vrygrond, this week. In Parkwood, the Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela concluded his meeting with residents and left the area. Hundreds of residents took to the streets to voice their frustrations on Sunday. Police shot rubber bullets at protesters after they were pelted with stones and golf balls. A 15-year-old boy was hospitalised after he was hit in the face with a projectile, and a rent office was set alight. No further incidents of violence have been reported in Vrygrond or Capricorn.
