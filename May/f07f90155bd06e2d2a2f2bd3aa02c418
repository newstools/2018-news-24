	        Send us your pictures   ·  Send us your stories Lithemba Magajana, a Grade 10 pupil at Gamble Street High School in Uitenhage, who is ranked number one in the cadet division by Judo South Africa, flew to Burundi on Monday to take part in the African Judo Cadet Championship. The event runs until Friday, GroundUp reported. This comes after Johannesburg-based company VVM put up the sponsorship money he needed. GroundUp reported in April that Judo South Africa could not help Lithemba with the R22 000 he needed to cover the cost of travel and accommodation because he was the only fighter from the Eastern Cape (the story was republished on News24). There needed to be more than one for provincial funding to kick in.

We are enthralled to follow him this week in Burundi and to watch his exciting career. We are rooting for you, Lithemba," said VVM spokesperson Tarina Meiring. His father and coach, Mzwandile Magajana, said: "This will be one of his dream fights." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
