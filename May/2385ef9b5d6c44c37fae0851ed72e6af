National spokesperson Khaya Xaba said if the task team failed to positively respond to the union's list of grievances, its members would down tools indefinitely. "Today we submitted a memorandum to the task team and we have given them 24 hours to respond positively to our demands. If they do not respond we will embark on a two-day stay away in the entire public service in the province," said Xaba. He said if that did not change the situation, members would engage other provinces to down tools in solidarity with the North West province. "Some of the issues that we want them to deal with are outsourcing, corruption, unpaid bonuses, overtime as well as occupational health and safety issues in the work place," he said.
