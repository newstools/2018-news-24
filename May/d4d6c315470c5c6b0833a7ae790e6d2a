Jenni Evans Western Cape police were handling two protests and a solidarity march in Hermanus, Gansbaai and Stanford on Monday, in addition to the protest that started in Mitchells Plain in Cape Town. Brigadier Donovan Heilbron, commander of the Overberg cluster, said a protest had started in Gansbaai after an alleged perlemoem poacher was injured on Sunday while trying to jump into a rubber dingy to evade arrest. Heilbron said some people in the community were upset by the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry's (DAFF) operation in the area on Sunday and, by Monday, some had blocked the main road with a burning barricade. Comment fromÂ  DAFF was not immediately available. A group of people also tried to block the R43, near to Stanford, on Monday over what is believed to be a protest over land. Two people had been arrested there for alleged public violence, he said. In Hermanus on Monday, about 2 000 people marched from Zwelihle ahead of the the court appearance of Gcobani Ndzongana, a leader in the push to get a privately-owned plot called Schulphoek signed over for development for backyarders, instead of the initial luxury development planned for that site. He faces charges of assault and intimidation, but the case was postponed. Heilbron said that, after Ndzongana's appearance, the large group of people who had walked to the Hermanus Magistrate's Court to support him, went back to Zwelihle without incident. Further information on the DAFF operation and the Standford issue were not immediately available. Police in Cape Town also had their hands full when a protest started on Eisleben Road in Mitchells Plain. Live ammunication was thought to have been used by some protesters. Police scrambled to the area to back up their colleagues. A police spokesperson could not immediately comment, as he was in a meeting.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
