Rapid response from police officials caused the attackers to escape empty handed.WATCH Three men, who allegedly robbed a Fidelity security guard of an undisclosed amount of cash in Fort Beaufort in the Eastern Cape, are expected to appear in court on Friday. Hawks spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni on Wednesday said the security guard was in the process of loading cash in an ATM at a SuperSpar in Fort Beaufort on Tuesday when the three men aged between 29 and 34 accosted him. The incident took place at about 11:40. "They disarmed him before they took an undisclosed amount of cash and fled the scene using a getaway vehicle that was waiting nearby," she said. Feni said members of the serious organised crime investigation unit of the Hawks and Fort Beaufort police launched their search for the alleged suspects immediately after the robbery. "At approximately 15:30 their investigation led them to Mdeni Village in Fort Beaufort where they arrested three men. Members also recovered four pistols, including the Fidelity pistol. "A portion of the undisclosed amount of money was also recovered," Feni said. Investigations are continuing and further arrests have not been ruled out, added Feni. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
