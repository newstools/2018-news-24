Sisulu said that the tragedy of her death showed that more had to be done to protect young South African women. "We must do more to protect women from being murdered by partners or former partners. We trust that the judicial system will take the necessary steps and send a clear message to perpetrators that South Africans are tired of such senseless killings and will not tolerate them." Former MUT student Thabani Mzolo, 23, who is accused of the murder, made his first court appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Mzolo is believed to be Khumalo's boyfriend READ: Arrested KZN student confessed on Facebook to killing ex-girlfriend Many MUT students gathered outside the court and tried to force their way onto the premises to get a glimpse of Mzolo. The students marched in their numbers from Point Road to the court and held up placards and chanted anti-woman abuse slogans. Many were dressed in ANC, IFP and EFF regalia. A smiling Mzolo appeared upbeat in the dock as his charges of murder and illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition were read out.
