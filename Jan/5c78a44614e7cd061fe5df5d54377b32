	     Cape Town - Police are on the hunt for a gang of robbers who hit a shebeen in Marikana, Cape Town and opened fire, killing two people and injuring three on Saturday night. According to police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk, the bullets flew at the establishment at about 22:30 when the group entered and robbed the patrons, randomly shooting at people. Two men, aged 29 and 33, were killed. "The injured [men] were taken to a nearby hospital for medical treatment," he said. Double murder and attempted murder cases are under investigation. The mass shooting comes four months after 11 people were killed in a tavern bloodbath in Marikana settlement in September, resulting in a manhunt which led to the arrest of four suspects in November.

The suspects, all locals, had been nabbed for unrelated crimes and were linked through forensic evidence and witness statements, police minister Fikile Mbalula said at the time.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
