Authorities say officers Tiffany Phillips and Carlos Guadalupe were directing traffic in the Hell's Kitchen neighbourhood when they were flagged down by a desperate motorist. The man told the officers that his wife was going into labour. Phillips says they ran to the car to find the woman ready to give birth and coached her through delivery as Guadalupe ran to a nearby hotel to get towels. Phillips says it was a "great sound" when the baby started to cry after delivery. Phillips, who is a 12-year veteran of the NYPD, drove the couple's car to Bellevue Hospital, where the mother and her newborn were doing well. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
