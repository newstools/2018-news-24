WJRT-TV reports Zachary Woodcock shot himself minutes after he accidentally shot 21-year-old Richard Skillman, who died at the scene. Saginaw County Sheriff's Lieutenant Mike Gomez said Woodcock was celebrating his birthday on January 19 with friends in his apartment in Merrill, northwest of Detroit. Gomez said Woodcock returned from his bedroom with a handgun that "went off and struck Mr Skillman in the chest". As others were helping Skillman, witnesses told police that Woodcock left the apartment. Gomez said: "They heard a shot, walked out and there he was." About 10 guns later were found in the apartment and Skillman's car.
