Itumeleng Setshaba Mokwena (39) appeared in the Jan Kempdorp Magistrate’s Court on charges of fraud and corruption on Monday, 22 January. Mokwena is accused of using a deceased customer’s details to submit fraudulent insurance claims for R30 000 at a furniture store in Jan Kempdorp. This claim was reportedly paid on 30 July 2014 and was shared between Mo­kwena and an accomplice. An investigation by the Hawks revealed that the beneficiary details of the deceased customer was altered and replaced by the recruited claimant. Capt. Philani Nkwalase, Hawks spokesperson, says the matter was reported to the police after a disagreement on the sharings. The case against Mokwena was postponed to Wednesday, 21 February, for further investigation. He was released on R3 000 bail. An additional arrest in this matter is imminent, says Nkwalase. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
