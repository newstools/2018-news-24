A Nigerian woman was left devastated after she made a public proposal to her boyfriend and got turned down. According to Nigerian Eye, the incident took place at Ikeja City Mall in Lagos. The video, which was posted by Twitter user @EnekemGreg, has gone viral. In the video, the woman can be seen kneeling down with a ring in her hand as the man walks down the escalator. The man, who appears to be astonished, declines the proposal and after a while walks towards the woman and helps her get up. He then whispers something to her and walks away, leaving her to cry uncontrollably. Ghlinks reports that a woman by the name of Christy Glo, who claims to be a friend of the woman in the video, explained in a Facebook post why the man had declined the proposal. "This lady is actually my friend, but not close friends and we just spoke on phone… She said the reason she cried bitterly after her boyfriend rejected her marriage proposal in public was that when he came close and whispered into her ears, he actually said he was already married. My question is why are men this wicked and heartless? Tufiakwa," she wrote on her Facebook account. Watch the video below:     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
