	     While many people were getting into the spirit of the festive season, others were getting it down and without condoms. According to a Sunday World report, morning-after pills and home pregnancy test kits sales shot through the roof, based on a poll, which the newspaper conducted, of pharmacies in Gauteng, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal.  The report claims that an average of 80 home pregnancy test kits and 50 morning-after pills were sold per day in one pharmacy in Lebowakgomo, Limpopo. Another Gauteng pharmacist confirmed to the publication that their store sold 2 200 morning-after pills and more than 52 800 home pregnancy tests from late November until the end of December. A KZN pharmacist revealed to the publication that when the festive season is approaching, they have to stock up because of the high demand. Gynaecologist Dr Phuti Ratshabedi was quoted saying: "It seems to me that falling pregnant for some women is resented more than [the fear of] contracting sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV. This is very worrying."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
