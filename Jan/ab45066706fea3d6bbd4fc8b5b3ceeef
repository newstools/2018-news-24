The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) condemned the incident. "It must be stated and emphasised that unbecoming behaviour by offenders in South Africa's correctional centres will not be tolerated," Correctional Services department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said in a statement. Management received a tip-off about a cellphone in E-Section at the prison, according to Nxumalo. When the warders attempted to enter E-Section, inmates allegedly threw hot water at them. Three of the officials sustained serious burn wounds and have been taken to surrounding hospitals for treatment. Nxumalo stressed that safety and security was of paramount importance and that the attack would be investigated. "This was clearly an act of retaliation and it is something that must be rooted out completely," he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
