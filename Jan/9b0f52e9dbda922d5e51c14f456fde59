Iavan Pijoos Johannesburg – Protesters from Thembelihle informal settlement, south of Johannesburg, barricaded the K43 road on Wednesday afternoon and stoned passing cars, the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) said. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the K43, in Lenasia, had been completely blocked off and was a "no go zone due to the violence of the protests there over the last few days". Minnaar said protesters were demanding housing. On Monday, the informal settlement's residents also took to the streets in a service delivery protest. Minnaar said motorists are advised to use Nivarna Drive and the Golden Highway as alternative routes.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
