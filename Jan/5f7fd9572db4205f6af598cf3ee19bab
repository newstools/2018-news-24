Captain Appel Ernst of Randfontein police station confirmed to YOU that the father and son have been reported missing at the police station. They didn’t arrive at their destination in Johannesburg and their family hasn’t heard from them since. Dessie says the Pink Ladies are following up on several leads. Martin was last seen dressed in a maroon T-shirt, shorts with a camouflage pattern and flip-flops. He also has an extra set of clothes with him: silver coloured shorts, a denim button shirt, grey sneakers and a green cap (with “Shut up and fish” written on it). The shirt has a bleach stain on the front left. Francois was wearing a blue, red and white striped T-shirt and blue shorts when they disappeared. He wasn’t wearing any shoes.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
