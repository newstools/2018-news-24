                    bottom Several people have been injured this morning following
protest action at a school in Falconridge in the Vaal area. ER24 paramedics were standing by at the school from the
early hours of the morning when they were alerted that several protesters had
been injured. Paramedics, along with the local authorities, made their way
through the crowds to the patients. Upon assessment, paramedics found that eight people had
sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Fortunately, no serious
injuries or fatalities were found. Paramedics treated the patients and thereafter transported
two to a nearby hospital for further treatment. The remaining patients declined
transportation to a hospital. Local authorities are on scene for further investigations. -
