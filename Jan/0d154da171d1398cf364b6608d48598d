	     Harare – Former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe's nephew Patrick Zhuwao has reportedly claimed that his uncle is being "ill-treated" by President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government. According to the privately owned Daily News, Zhuwao said this during an interview with Voice of America (VOA).  "They are ill-treating the old man, they went to prophets and traditional healers and were told the same that they are ill-treating the old man but they failed to change, they continue to ill-treat the old man," Zhuwawo was quoted as saying. "We must respect him (Mugabe) he went to war; he was jailed fighting for the people." Zhuwao's utterances came just a few weeks after Mnangagwa promised to look after the soon-to-be-94-year-old during his retirement.  Mnangagwa's government recently published regulations stating privileges owing to former presidents. They included a huge personal staff of cooks, waiters, gardeners and security officers, two houses, a fleet of cars and four international trips per year.   Zhuwao was part of a faction loyal to former first lady Grace Mugabe.  He insisted that Mnangagwa's government was illegitimate, adding that "our ancestors are not happy with what is happening".   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
