Masina is expected to first visit the crime scene where the women were gunned down and another wounded near an informal settlement in Daveyton on the East Rand on Thursday - four days after the discovery of seven decomposed bodies near a mine dump. Police suspect that the seven men – all Lesotho nationals - were killed by a rival mining gang. Their remains had been found on an open field in Benoni on Sunday. The women gathered on Thursday to mourn their death. Two gunmen entered the shack and fired several shots, it was alleged. A provincial task team has been assigned to the case. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
