Other members of the Grade 4 Maths WhatsApp group have also been hounded, after a screengrab of the snap somehow made its way to social media. “I’m a positive person, but my life has been turned upside down by this,” one mom, who wishes to remain anonymous, revealed to YOU. She is one of the parents who responded to the bare-breasted photo a woman called Natasha sent to the WhatsApp group. "I’m not even the one who sent the photo but men call me in the middle of the night or even try to WhatsApp video call me.” "It just doesn’t stop. How can men have so little respect for women?” she added. Her number can be seen on the screengrab. "Now everyone is calling me. I even get calls from New Zealand. I'm losing my mind,” she said furiously. According to her, the photo was shared on the group eight months ago. "We all decided to handle it like adults, but someone on the group was heartless and thought it was very funny to share the screengrab." "It was my birthday recently, and one would like to be able to answer their phone when people call them to wish them well, but I'm too scared.” “I’m going to change my number soon.” The parent says there is already an ongoing investigation to locate the person who shared the screengrab. Another parent on the group told YOU she was also being harassed by "perverted men". "It makes me mad," she said in a WhatsApp message. "I know what's happening, but it's not my business and a long forgotten issue." Natasha has since removed her Facebook profile. Her phone is also off and her voicemail is full. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
