WATCH Johannesburg – Three alleged illegal miners, known as zama-zamas, were shot dead and 14 others were arrested following a shootout with police in Boksburg on the East Rand on Monday morning, Gauteng police said. A fourth man also died, although the circumstances around the cause of death was being investigated. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said police officers and members of the Ekurhuleni Metro Police (EMPD) had been following up information on people who were heavily armed near the Angelo informal settlement in Boksburg. "On reacting to information, a confrontation between them and the suspects resulted in a shootout. Police officers were not injured," Dlamini said. He said three zama-zamas were shot dead and a fourth man "possibly died of shock". "Police will only know the circumstances of his death after the post-mortem has been concluded." He said four rifles, a pistol and explosives suspected to be used by illegal miners were seized. "As police continue to deal with illegal mining, it is believed that the firearms confiscated are used by rival gangs to attack each other." According to Dlamini, it was the second incident in three months, in the same area, in which police were involved in a shootout with suspected illegal miners. The 14 people arrested were charged with possession of unlicensed firearms and attempted murder. A further charge of illegal mining might be added, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
