Dozens of people attacked a police station in Cairo's Mokattam neighborhood on January 6 after a young detainee held on drug-related suspicions died in custody. Police arrested 43 protesters. The state-run MENA news agency said the two policemen will go on trial Febuary 15. No date has been set for the protesters. Anger at widespread police brutality helped spark the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Rights groups say mistreatment and torture are still widespread in Egyptian prisons, allegations denied by the government.
