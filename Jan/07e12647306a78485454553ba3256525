	     Mogadishu - The US military says it has carried out an airstrike in Somalia that killed two al-Shabaab extremists and destroyed a vehicle carrying explosives, "preventing it from being used against the people in Mogadishu." The US Africa Command statement says the airstrike occurred early on Tuesday about 50km west of the capital. It says no civilians were killed. Mogadishu is frequently targeted by the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab. The extremist group was blamed for the October truck bombing that killed 512 people in the capital. The US military carried out more than 30 drone strikes last year against al-Shabaab and fighters linked to the Islamic State group after the Trump administration approved expanded operations in the Horn of Africa nation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
