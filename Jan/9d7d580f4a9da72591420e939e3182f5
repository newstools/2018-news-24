	     Johannesburg - A 19-year-old man was shot and killed in Tshepisong West, Johannesburg by unknown suspects, police said. A witness and neighbour to the shooting alleged that he was asleep when he heard gunshots outside his shack and ran outside to assist, Kagiso police spokesperson Captain Solomon Sibiya said in a statement on Friday. The man ran into the witness's shack in an attempt to escape from his assailants.   "When he tried to close the door behind him, the suspects fired another shot that went through the door to his upper body. "He then fell on top of the witness's bed and three suspects, two of whom [were] armed with firearms entered. They ordered the witness to accompany them to the deceased's shack. On arrival the suspects ransacked the shack and took R100 cash," Sibiya said. Before the suspects fled the scene, the witness was accompanied to his own shack where he was blindfolded and bound. "We suspect that the man may be from abroad, so we still need to contact his next of kin," Sibiya told News24. "At the moment we are still investigating the motive for the shooting and no arrests have been made yet," he added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
