"Five people were killed on Western Cape roads over the weekend, compared to an average of 15 fatalities every weekend in 2017," he said. Payne attributed these improvements to enhancements in integrated planning and praised the commitment shown by law enforcement agencies and municipalities. He added that strengthened partnerships with South Africa's national roads agency, Sanral, the Safely Home campaign and "engineering colleagues across the province are clearly bearing fruit", he added.  Payne warned all road users to exercise caution on the roads and for motorists to avoid drinking and driving.
