Youssef Nada's letter was posted on his Facebook account on Monday. The letter has provided media loyal to President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi with ammunition to link the would-be candidate, former chief of staff Sami Annan, to the banned Brotherhood. Authorities accuse the group of taking up arms against the government. Sisi led the military's 2013 ouster of former president Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist and Brotherhood stalwart. Under el-Sissi, links to the Brotherhood are grounds for prosecution. Nada cited the demand to free Morsi, in jail since 2013, as one of the Brotherhood's conditions for supporting Annan. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
