	     Cairo - Prosecutors in Egypt have detained a female singer for four days for "incitement to debauchery" after an online video clip sparked controversy, a judicial source said on Tuesday. Leila Amer appeared at the end of December in a music video called "Boss Oumek" ("Look at your mother") which includes sensual oriental dance and suggestive gestures. Musicians' union president Hany Shaker, a male singer known for his conservative stance, last week announced on the private channel Dream TV that Amer had been expelled from the union. Her case comes less than a month after another female pop singer was sentenced to two years in prison for "inciting debauchery" over a racy video. Shyma appeared in a mock classroom licking an apple and appearing to mimic fellatio on a banana in front of a chalkboard scrawled with "Class #69". On Monday her sentence was reduced on appeal to a year in jail. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
