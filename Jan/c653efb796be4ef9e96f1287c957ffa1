Bargain hunters rushed to shops to get their hands on the hazelnut spread, swarming into aisles to grab the pots. One store sold the same amount of Nutella it usually shifts in three months amid the chaotic scenes in French supermarkets on Friday. The hysteria was even captured on camera and isn’t unlike the scenes captured during Black Friday sales. One customer who was shopping in the town of Rive-de-Gier told Le Progres: “They are like animals.” French reports claimed that local police even had to be called out to calm the chaos. The scramble to the shops was sparked when Intermarche slashed the usual price of the jars by 70%. Some stores even had to limit the amount of spread each customer could buy to three and some shops sold out of their stock within 15 minutes. – The Mirror 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
