	     Durban – A farmer accused of shooting and killing a mourner at a funeral on his Cramond farm in Pietermaritzburg is to remain in custody until Tuesday.  National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara said the matter had been rolled over.  The 66-year-old farmer had apparently asked people who were attending the funeral to leave around 13:00 on Saturday in the Otto's Bluff area. Police said that when one of the family members tried to intervene, the farmer drew his gun and allegedly shot the man.  The victim, aged 42, sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body. He died at the scene. After the shooting, the farmer fled the scene in his vehicle.  However, police were able to apprehend and arrest him. He was found in possession of two rifles, one 9mm pistol and a toy gun. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
