Armed with placards with their qualifications, work experience and contact details on them, the three graduates hit Old Howick Road in Wembley last Wednesday, January 10, and again on Tuesday,         January 16, to try their luck in securing employment. The three are Minenhle Khanyezi (26), Senzo Dlamini (26) and Kufikakwenkosi Khomo (27), B-Tech Management graduates who obtained their qualifications in 2015. Khomo, however, acquired a post-graduate certificate in education last year. “Ever since we graduated we have been applying for jobs but nothing has materialised,” Dlamini said. The three said they chose Old Howick Road because they believe it is an area frequented by individuals who would most likely help them. Khanyezi said on their first day they received two business cards from people driving by. “But those positions were for IT graduates,” he said. According to Khomo, on their first day at a traffic light on Old Howick Road, they got a lot of encouragement from drivers who would hoot and some make a brief stop to share uplifting words. “Some of us were put through school by our grandparents, so the situation at home is not that great that is why we have resorted to looking for work in this manner,” Dlamini. This act of desperation by these graduates is not a novelty. In recent years, reports in the media have surfaced and social media posts have gone viral of graduates resorting to the same efforts seeking employment. Khanyezi said they are concerned that the number of graduates will increase since President Jacob Zuma announced free tertiary education for the poor in December last year, while the unemployment crisis will remain unresolved. “That is why we decided to try by all means to get work. We are not picky, as long as we can get work experience and grow in our field,” he said. The three said they spent five to six hours on the road on Wednesday, January 10, and more or less the same amount of time this past Tuesday, and vowed to continue to do so until something positive happens.
