	     A woman in her mid-20s was found dead on Tuesday morning at the Jika Joe informal settlement after allegedly being set alight. Pietermaritzburg police spokesperson Mthokozisi Ngobese said the woman’s body was discovered in one of the shacks at around 7 am by neighbours. “Residents saw smoke coming out from one of the shacks. They found the door was locked from outside so they broke down the door to extinguish the fire,” said Ngobese. Ngobese said after they had extinguished the fire, the residents discovered the body of an unknown woman. He said the owner of the shack had left keys with a friend who stayed close by when they went home to the Eastern Cape for the holidays. “Police are investigating a murder case and no one has been arrested yet,” said Ngobese. A crowd of shocked neighbours had gathered around the shack that was cordoned off with police tape. A resident, who asked not to be named, said they found the woman’s body wrapped in a blanket and her she was partially burnt. Nkululeko Wanda, a member of the community ward committee, said the they was shaken by the incident. “We have never had something like this happen in our community before so this came a huge shock to all of us,” he said. “We are co-operating with the police and helping them with all the necessary information and if there was any foul play in the death of this woman we hope that the wrong-doer is caught and brought to book.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
