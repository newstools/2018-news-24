MENA says Tuesday's ruling by the Cairo Criminal Court sentenced four other defendants to 15 years on similar charges, including belonging to a terrorist group, murder and planning attacks against the state. Another two defendants got five years in prison. The verdict can be appealed. The Muslim Brotherhood won a series of free elections after Egypt's 2011 uprising, and a senior Brotherhood figure, Mohammed Morsi, was elected president in 2012. A year later, the military overthrew Morsi amid mass protests against his rule. Authorities have since arrested thousands of Brotherhood members and branded it a terrorist organisation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
