Norman Magaya, the CEO of the opposition National Super Alliance, said on Monday the heavy deployment of the police to Uhuru Park in Nairobi will not stop the ceremony. Odinga claims he won the presidential election despite the electoral commission's official declaration that President Uhuru Kenyatta was the victor. The Supreme Court nullified Kenyatta's August win after Odinga challenged it claiming electoral fraud. The court said the results from that election were "null and void" and ordered a fresh vote in October which Kenyatta won after Odinga boycotted, citing a lack of electoral reforms. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
