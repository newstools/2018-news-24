Both government and opposition forces have committed multiple violations since the cease-fire began on December 24, according to four separate investigations released on Tuesday by the Cease-fire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism, an independent body. The reports also say that child soldiers continue to be recruited and sexual violence remains prevalent. South Sudan's opposition is charged with spearheading an attack on the town of Koch, just hours after the cease-fire was implemented. For its part, government forces are accused of looting civilian property and initiating clashes in and around the town of Mundri in the Equatoria region. Both sides deny the reports' accuracy and blame each other for the violations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
