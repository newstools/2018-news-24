Eben van Niekerk, Nashwill Julies, Vernon Witbooi and Geraldo Parsons were arrested after the brutal attack on Cornelius and her close friend, Cheslin Marsh, in May 2017. The two had been sitting chatting in her VW Citi Golf outside a block of flats in Bird Street in the student town when they were overpowered.
