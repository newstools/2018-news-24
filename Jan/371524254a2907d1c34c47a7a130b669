A blog titled "Holding Hypocrisy" appeared on the MyNews24 section of News24 on Saturday evening. The piece was a blog submission from a reader, criticising Holding in a vile and racist manner, and making serious claims about his personal life. The blog was taken down shortly after readers flagged it on social media. "We have properly investigated the circumstances leading to the publication of this disgusting piece. We have terminated the services of the freelance content producer who published the piece and have added extra approval measures to strengthen our checks and balances pertaining to user generated content," said News24 editor Adriaan Basson. "This piece does not represent the values and standards of News24 and its journalists. Although we provide a platform for readers to voice their opinions in the form of MyNews24, we will never allow this to be abused by racists and sexists." Basson said he would also be referring the matter to News24's newly appointed public editor, Professor George Claassen, to assist the team in ensuring that its approval system was on par with international standards. "I apologise unreservedly to Mr Holding and our readers for this failure of our oversight system. We have learnt our lesson and have taken firm action to ensure that this doesn't happen again."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
