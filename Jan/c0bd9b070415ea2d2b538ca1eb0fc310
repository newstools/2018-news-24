In light of this the leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Mmusi Maimane released a letter to speaker of the national assembly, Baleka Mbete, today requesting that Sona be postponed until President Jacob Zuma has been removed from office. In the letter Maimane states that Sona cost over R11 million last year and that the country cannot afford to waste public money for Jacob Zuma to deliver the government’s programme of action for the coming year. But political analyst Ralph Mathekga says, “The DA has no basis to stop the proper function of the state and government on the basis of an internal squabble within the party. There are no grounds for this – it is purely frivolous politicking. All the DA can do is wait for members of the ANC to instigate a motion and they can then join hands to remove Zuma. This does not necessarily mean that the ANC is not in trouble, they are in serious trouble because if they go ahead with Zuma to the Sona then it is more likely to be disruptive.” This comes after a letter from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to Mbete, seen by City Press, warning that if the motion is not scheduled before Sona, the EFF will raise the matter during the address.
