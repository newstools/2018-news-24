	     Harare - Academics at the University of Zimbabwe have petitioned the
anti-corruption commission to investigate the "suspicious" way in which former
first lady Grace Mugabe was awarded a doctorate four years ago. The academics from the university's sociology department say
they were “shocked” when Grace Mugabe emerged among the doctoral candidates in
2014. “This was a shock to many members of the department as most
members never (saw) or heard about the proposal, progress reports, thesis
examiners and outcome of such a study by the candidate,” reads part of the
petition, quoted by the private Zimbabwe Independent. “The awarding of the degree has therefore not gone through
processes that other candidates are subjected to which makes the awarding of
the degree very suspicious,” the petition adds. Grace Mugabe was capped by her husband, then president
Robert Mugabe, in August 2014 when he was still chancellor of the university.
She appeared in the red academic gown and black cap for the doctorate of
philosophy degree beside the then vice president, Joice Mujuru, who also
received a doctorate. Mujuru’s doctoral thesis has subsequently been released into
the public domain, but Grace's thesis has never been made available. At the time Grace was reported to have enrolled for
the doctorate just three months before it was awarded. Prominent graduates of
the university, which has a distinguished track record, were outraged. The late
Zimbabwean author, Chenjerai Hove at the time wrote to the university’s vice chancellor,
Levi Nyagura saying the university’s decision to give a doctorate to Grace had reduced its degrees to “a laughing stock”. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
