"Developing countries do have difficulties, these difficulties are not small things," she said. She said the United States also faced difficulties, like unemployment and inequality. - READ: South Africans react to Trump's 'shithole' remark "We would not deign to make comments as derogatory about any country facing difficulties," Duarte said.  DA leader Mmusi Maimane described the comments as  "abhorrent".
