Sanef said, although there was no evidence that Nare was shot because of his profession, journalists should be allowed to do their work without the fear of threats, intimidation or murder.

Nare was shot and killed near his home in Florida, Johannesburg in what was initially said to be a shootout with Metro police officers on April 17, 2017. The three officers were arrested on Thursday, following an Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) investigation which revealed that, "contrary to the version of the officers that they were shot at, they in fact killed Nare and staged the crime scene to cover their tracks," a statement released on Thursday read.

The three are expected to appear at the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Friday on charges of murder, assault and defeating the ends of justice.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
