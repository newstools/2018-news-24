Although police prevented a group of EFF protesters from entering the store, H&M and surrounding stores shut their doors as a precaution. The EFF protesters mobilised to demonstrate their outrage at a recent controversy involving H&M. The popular chain has recently come under international criticism for using a black child to advertise a hoodie bearing the slogan "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle". Police and mall security were posted outside the H&M store and the surrounding area to curb damage to property and prevent looting, similar to the kind that occurred at Gauteng branches earlier this week. H&M has issued an apology for offending customers. H&M spokesperson Amelia-May Woudstra said the company was "deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and [also regretted] the actual print". She conceded “the image published was distasteful and hurtful to the broader public". EFF leader Julius Malema stated at a ground forces forum in Westenburg, Polokwane, on Saturday that the EFF "would make no apology" for the damage that EFF protests have caused to H&M stores. "No one should make jokes about the dignity of black people and [be] left unattended to." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
