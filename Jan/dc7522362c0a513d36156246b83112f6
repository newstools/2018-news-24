The captain was apprehended at the Department of Correctional Services in Tshwane. He is accused of allegedly defrauding the crime intelligence fund. The officer has also been allegedly linked to the R200m heist at OR Tambo International Airport that took place in March last year, News24 previously reported. An affidavit seen by News24 shows that two requests for blinds and curtains for safe houses in Pretoria were submitted by the captain and authorised by a major-general to the tune of R563 005. An investigation found that the actual cost for services rendered was R78 763.06. According to a Department of Justice document, also seen by News24, the officer was arrested in 1994 and convicted in 1996 for robbery with aggravating circumstances, which he unsuccessfully appealed. He served just over two years of a 10-year prison sentence at Groenpunt Maximum Correctional Service Centre, from June 20, 2013 to November 26, 2015 and was re-employed by SAPS after he was released on parole, IPID said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
