Cumberland road in Kensington is making the rounds on social media. In the
video, which was posted by Facebook group, Intelligence
Bureau SA, three suspects are seen getting out of a blue Toyota Corolla to
rob a man at gunpoint. The victim is seen standing next to a white Toyota Fortuner parked
outside what appears to be the gate to his house when he is surrounded by the
robbers, before they search his car and make their getaway. According to Intelligence
Bureau SA, the suspects took cellphones, a small amount of cash and some
baby clothes which were in the car. Nobody was physically injured and no shots
were fired. Speaking to DRUM, Captain Richard Monyayi of the Jeppe
Police Station said that they didn’t have any record of a case being opened
fitting that description. “We don’t have such records, so it might be that the
robbery was not reported. We have checked our records, but we couldn’t find
anything,” he said. Watch the video here:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
