	     Johannesburg – Police have warned motorists to avoid driving along the Golden Highway and Welgevonden Road, towards Orange Farm, due to protest action that erupted on Friday afternoon. Captain Kay Makhubela told News24 that the protest action by Palm Springs residents related to an interrupted water supply, with community members saying they planned to protest until their water was reconnected.  Makhubela could not confirm how many people were protesting, but said public order police (POP), the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) and other police officials were on the scene to monitor the situation. "Protestors are allegedly burning tyres and throwing stones at passing cars, so we are asking for motorists to avoid using this route," he said. The JMPD's Wayne Minnaar was not immediately available for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
