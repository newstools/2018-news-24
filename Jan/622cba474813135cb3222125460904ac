                    bottom #LifeEsidimeni: Moseneke wants to know why Mahlangu said the NGO's were dishonest? Mahlangu says she doesn't remember. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Mahlangu reads out a letter responding to SADAG which she says Lebethe, Manamela and Selebano should get legal team involved because "these NGO's are dishonest". @TeamNews24 Hassim asks Mahlangu if she was ever suspicious of  SADAG? Mahlangu: I am not sure why I would be suspicious of them. #LifeEsidimeni: Mahlangu says since she does not have all the files of things that have happen she did not expect anyone to be lying. "I had no reason to doubt any information given to me." @TeamNews24 Moseneke: "Why would Selebano and Manamela lie to you so openly?" Mahlangu: " I really don't know, Justice." #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim says the information that was provided by Mahlangu to the legislature was not correct.  "isn't that so"? Mahlangu says information was given by officials. @TeamNews24 Hassim states that the information provided in November by
Mahlangu at Legislature on availability of beds was not correct. Mahlangu says yes and information was provided by officials.
She says she is shocked and disappointed after Moseneke asks if she was shocked
at this. #LifeEsidimeni: Hassim asks if Mahlangu reported to the legislature about the information regarding Precious Angels and bodies lying at the morgueMahlangu says she reported to the legislature about every aspect she was aware of. @TeamNews24 Moseneke: "You don’t include some of the information that in fact was in a letter whose receipt you acknowledge. Counsel is entitled to [ask] but why didn’t you say this?"Mahlangu: "I reported to legislature the best that I could." #LifeEsidimeni #LifeEsidimeni: Mahlangu says her responsibilities are not operational and she would not know of all the more than 1000 patients in Gauteng when they were moved. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim wants to know why Mahlangu did not report to the legislature about the complaints she received about Precious Angels. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Mahlangu says she doesn't seem to remember very well who dealt with the complaint from Section 27 pertaining to Precious Angels. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Hassim: You had a complaint about Precious Angels and bodies lying at the morgue. Why didn't you tell that to the legislature?Mahlangu gives a long answer.Moseneke interjects and explains the question to Mahlangu #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim asks Mahlangu why she did not answer complaints relating to Precious Angels and bodies lying at the morgue Mahlangu: When I answered a question to the legislature it was pertaining to the number of death. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Hassim: You said you received a complaint from one NGO - but that isn't true is it? The letter ends with asking when Mahlangu will be urgently available to discuss matters of email. Mahlangu says she is not sure if her visit to Precious Angel was triggered by the email. Mahlangu says she is not aware who she asked and how the matter be dealt to take the matters forward. Mahlangu never responded to @SECTION27news concerns about deadly Precious Angels NGO. Instead, asked head of department Barney Selebano to follow up. #LifeEsidimeni Reverting does not necessarily man responding by email, it may mean responding via someone else, Mahlangu tells advocate Hassim. Mahlangu asks for time to read over letter in question. #LifeEsidimeni "why do you say you have to be careful because it will be used against you or the government"?Mahlangu: I don't know. At times information can be used as political football. Adv Hassim: Did you receive reports of bodies lying at funeral undertaker? Mahlangu: No I was not aware.  #LifeEsidimeni @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim says death rate at NGO's was far higher than the death rate at #LifeEsidimeni. #QedaniMahlangu: "Yes, I can see that." @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Moseneke asks Mahlangu if she believed the deaths were due to natural causes - she says yes. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Mahlangu says on  14 September, Prof Makgoba said that it was virtually unheard of to have 36 deaths rapidly  - toxicological evidence is needed.  @TeamNews24 Hassim asks Mahlangu if it's true that she initiated the investigation, and not Professor Makgoba. "Yes, it's true," Mahlangu responds.  Moseneke once again reminds Mahlangu to keep her answers simple, and to "reduce her emotions". "I'm here to protect you," he says, to get answers.  #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim asks Mahlangu why she couldn't come earlier to the hearings when she was asked to. Moseneke says Mahlangu could just answer by saying she was studying. @TeamNews24 Hassim: "Is government paying for your studies abroad?" Mahlangu: "No." Hassim then asks if Mahlangu went overseas because she knew it would make it harder for people to contact her.  #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim asks Mahlangu if government is paying for her studies abroad.Mahlangu: Why would government pay for my studies? @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim asked if Mahlangu was offered any package after her resignation - she says she wasn't offered any golden handshake. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Mahlangu says she tendered her resignation on Feb 1 2017. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim asks Mahlangu what she meant in her resignation letter when she said she was taking political accountability. Mahlangu: I realised that things have gone wrong under her leadership. @TeamNews24 Hassim now refers to Mahlangu's resignation letter, and the ombud's report, saying its contents amounts to culpability on Mahlangu's part. Mahlangu disagrees.  #LifeEsidimeni Mahlangu says she doesn’t agree with the Ombud that she was negligent. @TeamNews24 Hassim: "Do you agree that Section 27 of the Constitution binds you as an MEC?" Mahlangu gives another prolonged response, before Moseneke interrupts her once again just to remind her that a simple "yes" or "no" would suffice, and thereafter she can explain her answer. Mahlangu: "Yes, sorry Justice (Moseneke)."  Adv Hassim: Do you agree that the ombud found your conduct amounted to negligent? Mahlangu: My duties are defined by the PFMA (Public Finance Management Act). #LifeEsidimeni @TeamNews24 Advocate Hassim once again firmly asks Mahlangu to stop evading questions, as it could end up prolonging the whole process.  Mahlangu: "My resignation was subjecting myself to accountability..."  #LifeEsidimeni:  Advocate Hassim asks #QedaniMahlangu if she agrees with the findings of the report against her - she says she doesn't agree with the findings relating to her  in her capacity as MEC. @TeamNews24 Advocate Hassim asks Mahlangu to please specifically answer the questions she is asked.  #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim says she wants a yes or no answer but Mahlangu dodges the question of whether she agrees with the report and says she has indicated that the loss of life is regrettable.  @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Adv Hassim asks Mahlangu if she agrees with the contents of the report of the ombudsman - she says government has accepted the repot. @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni: Section 27's Adv Adila Hassim is now cross-examining #QedaniMahlangu. @TeamNews24 Proceedings resume.  #LifeEsidimeni proceedings are now underway. @TeamNews24 Jump to
