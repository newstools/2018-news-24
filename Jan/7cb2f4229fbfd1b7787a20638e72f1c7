	     Cairo - More than 500 of Egypt's 596 lawmakers have signed "recommendations" for President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi to run for a second, four-year term in this year's elections. Al-Sisi has not announced his candidacy, but he is virtually certain to contest, and win, the March vote. Under the constitution, at least 20 elected members of parliament must formally recommend a presidential hopeful to allow him or her to qualify as a candidate. Alternatively, 25 000 recommendations from voters must be collected, with a minimum of 1 000 in 15 of Egypt's 29 provinces. Al-Sissi has said he will announce his candidacy after receiving feedback on his track record since taking office, without elaborating. His office this week invited Egyptians to submit questions online for him to answer on live television. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
