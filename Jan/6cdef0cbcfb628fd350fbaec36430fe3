It will be the first UN peacekeeper presence in Akobo since 2013, when the base was abandoned after armed men stormed the compound and killed three Indian peacekeepers. This time the U.N. plans to fly in peacekeepers only a few days a week. The first peacekeepers are expected to arrive in the next few weeks. South Sudan's five-year civil war has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions amid warnings of ethnic violence. The latest cease-fire, which took effect December 24, was broken just hours later with both sides blaming each other for the violations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
