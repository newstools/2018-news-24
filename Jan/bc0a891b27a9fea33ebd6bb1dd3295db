The Ladybrand Regional Court has sentenced gun thief Tokelo Johannes Nonyana (29) to 25 yearsâ€™ imprisonment. At his recent appearance, the court found the accused guilty on two counts: unlawful possession of unlicensed firearms and possession of unlicensed ammunition. He received ten years on the first count and 15 years on the second count. Sgt Martin Xuma, spokesperson of the police cluster, says the sentences will run concurrently. He says the firearm, a Sako 7 mm rifle, 12 Sako live rounds, 11 R4 rifle live rounds and four R1 live rounds, were stolen during a burglary in the Kommissiepoort area in November 2013. Xuma said that the police, acting on a tip-off, arrested the accused in Mokwena Location, Thaba Nchu, after the firearm and ammunition were found at the house. Nonyana was apprehended for unlawful possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Xuma says the sentencing was the result of teamwork between the Selosesha and Kommissiepoort Detective units. The accused, Nonyana, had been on trial since 2013. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
