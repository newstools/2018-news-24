Avril Fillies Siphamandla and Manyano Secondary Schools have obtained the highest success rate in the 2017 matric exams with a pass rate of 92,8 and 90,1 percentage respectively. Sizimisele and Esangweni Secondary Schools obtained the lowest pass rate with 38,3 and 49,4 percentage. These schools are all part of the Metro East Education District and include schools from Lwandle bin Strand and Khayelitsha. “In the past Metro East always ended eighth of all the Education Districts of the department and overall we dropped from 80% of last year to 77,7 this year. This is the first time since 2011 that the pass rate is below 80%,” said Benjamin Scherenka, Director of Metro East Education District. He added that you’ll have to see the results in the right perspective, taking in consideration the areas that falls under the district. “We service schools in Khayelitsha, Lwandle, Assanda Village in the Helderberg, Bellville. Blue Downs, Eerste River and all the informal settlements in Kraaifontein. The learners in these areas have to cope with social issues such as poverty, unemployment, dependant on social grants and gang violence. I must admit I am disappointed in the results but taking the social issues in consideration, we can only improve on the results of 2017,” Scherenka said. The top matriculant in the country is from his district and he is proud of Janke van Dyk of Bellville High.  Last year the district was proud of the learner from De Kuilen High that came second countrywide. “You must also keep in mind that the Western Cape overall dropped from second place to third place as well. I am very glad about the 30% matriculants that passed with a bachelors that enable them to study for a degree at any university in the country,” he said. He also mentioned that to be recognised country wide that your district delivered the top matriculant, is also something to be proud of. “I am sure that the 2017 results are only a small hiccup but watch this space for the Class of 2018. They will definitely improve on the 77,7%,” Scherenka said.
