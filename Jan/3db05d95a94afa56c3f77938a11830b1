The Richards Bay Hawks, Mpumalanga Border Police, and Crime Intelligence intercepted the 50-year-old suspect at the Golela border post in KwaZulu-Natal after they received information about a truck smuggling heroin, Hawks national spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement. "A thorough search was conducted and almost 200kg of heroin powder was found hidden in the back of the truck. "The value is yet to be determined, but is expected to run into millions of rand," he said.
