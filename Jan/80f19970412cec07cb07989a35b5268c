In the horrific video, a group of four men run into the frame and appear to be looking at something when one of the men pulls out a gun and shoots another man, who is standing in front of him, in the head before running away. The unidentified man immediately falls to the ground before bystanders notice that he has been shot. After a while, a group of people begin gathering around the man, lying on the ground on his back. The video has had over 66 000 views on Facebook. DRUM spoke to Hillbrow SAPS Captain Sifiso Madizela, who confirmed that three people were involved in the shootout − one is deceased, while another is still in hospital. “I can confirm that the shootout was as a result of a business robbery that took place and that one of the alleged criminals was confirmed dead on the scene.” Watch the video here:          24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
