Justice has finally prevailed for murdered Botshabelo teenage girl Lindiwe Samson after more than three years. This follows the sentencing of Zongezile Patrick Mashinini (22) to life imprisonment. On 12 December last year, the Botshabelo Magistrate’s Court sentenced him for the rape and murder of the teenager in February 2014. This ends the three years and ten months wait for justice for the victim, who was 14 at the time. Const. Maselela Langa, provincial police spokesperson, said Mashinini handed himself over to the police in Gauteng in September 2016 and confessed to raping and murdering Lindiwe. “He was arrested and charged with rape and the murder of the victim,” said Langa. He said the victim’s body, with a knife stab wound, was discovered in an open veld in Botshabelo. “An inquest docket was opened to determine the cause of death and it later emerged during investigation that the girl had been raped and murdered,” said Langa. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
