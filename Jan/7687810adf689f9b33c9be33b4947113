Human rights activist Wanjeri Nderu estimates that more than 500 people responded on Tuesday to a call on social media to demonstrate and present a petition demanding action by Kenyatta National Hospital.

One woman says a medic fondled her while she was partially conscious after surgery. The hospital has denied the allegations.
