The man who died was involved in a head-on collision in Shallcross on Saturday night – which left "total chaos" in its wake, said Rescue Care’s operations director Garrith Jamieson. "Two vehicles lay extensively damaged. Two occupants were severely entrapped in the one vehicle." Four people were stabilised on the scene before being taken to hospital. In a separate accident, five people were injured after the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in lost control, causing it to roll and come to rest on its roof. The accident occurred on the M7 east-bound near Sarnia Road on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, earlier in central Durban, on the corner of Stanger Street and Argyle Road, two people were injured after their vehicles collided at a T-junction. They sustained minor injuries. On Friday, a cyclist sustained moderate injuries after colliding with a vehicle. She was rushed to hospital. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
