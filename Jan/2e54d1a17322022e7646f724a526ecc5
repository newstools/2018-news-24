– The Zimbabwean government has reportedly withdrawn ex-first lady Grace Mugabe's
state security detail, with most aides formally assigned to her being "recalled
and reassigned". According
to NewsDay, Grace used to have security agents specifically assigned to her
before she was kicked out of the ruling Zanu-PF party where she was the leader
of the women's league.  The
report said that Grace’s security agents were "withdrawn progressively until
Monday".   "She no longer has a team that is dedicated to her," a source was
quoted as saying. "Grace will largely depend on the team that is assigned to the
former president. She can no longer determine how the aides operate, but will
be an indirect beneficiary of her husband." Presidential
spokesperson, George Charamba could not confirm the development but said: "logically,
I believe it would be expensive for the government to provide security to
Chatunga [Mugabe’s youngest child] now whenever he travels to America or
decides to relocate there. “I think the idea is that security details and other benefits
are accrued to the principal [Mugabe]. "Other members now enjoy
through the principal and not by virtue of their position or association." This came just a few weeks after Mnangagwa promised to look after
the soon-to-be-94-year-old Mugabe during his retirement. Mnangagwa's government recently
published regulations stating privileges owing to former presidents. They
included a huge personal staff of cooks, waiters, gardeners and security
officers, two houses, a fleet of cars and four international trips per year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
