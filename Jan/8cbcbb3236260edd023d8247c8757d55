The freeway had to be closed, which resulted in congestion and traffic jams on routes leading into Johannesburg. JMPD's Wayne Minnaar told News24 that the name of the passenger could not be revealed as his family had not been notified of his death yet. "One male in his 60s died when a bus driver lost control and spiralled into three other vehicles. There was already another accident," he said. Minnaar said two lanes had been opened and urged road users to use the M2 Joe Slovo off-ramp, before joining the highway again after Houghton. Police and the JMPD are still on the scene.
