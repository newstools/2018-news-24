The two German nationals were looking at the sea when they were held up by a man with a sharp object that the victims believed was a knife. The man demanded their cellphones and money and then grabbed the car keys and ran to the tourists’ car, where another two men were waiting. The suspects got into the car and made off with all the tourists’ personal belongings, including their passports, luggage and ­bicycles. The car was later recovered in Tafelsig. Speedy police work led to the arrest of two men – aged 26 and 27 respectively – on Tuesday at 10:00. The arrest came after sector commanders and officers from the Provincial Intervention Task Team followed up on information received. Police recovered an Orbea bicycle, three bottles of wine, a backpack and three luggage bags, as well as various other items including a bicycle tube, sensor, light and hairdryer. The items were all reported as part of the stolen goods. The suspects face a charge of possession of stolen property and robbery. They are expected to appear in court soon and the investigation continues. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
