speech The civil rights organisation AfriForum considers laying a
complaint of hate speech against the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) after EFF
protesters yesterday chanted the phrases "White man, you must die", "Shoot
to kill the Boere" and several other racist and inciting remarks during a
protest at Hoërskool Overvaal. AfriForum's legal team will today serve a lawyer's letter on
the leadership of the EFF in which the party is asked to explain their stance
on this incident. "If these actions do not comply with EFF policies, we
demand that the party distances itself unconditionally and institutes
disciplinary action," says Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum. "If the party is however unwilling to do this,
AfriForum will lay a complaint of hate speech against the party in terms of the
Equality Act." - Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO “You’re working for the whites.
