	     Cape Town – A man was shot and killed at the Bellville taxi rank in Cape Town, Western Cape police said on Thursday. The shooting occurred at around 19:10 on Belrail Road on Wednesday, according to police spokesperson Sinathi Joni. Police have yet to identify the man. Eyewitness and Bellville taxi rank manager Mogamad Shafiek Gordon said the man was a taxi rank employee. "We passed each other as I went to close the rank at 19:00. He went outside when I went into the office," he told News24. "I heard gunshots so I ran with other people to take cover and when I eventually came outside to check what had happened, I found his body next to my car," recalled Gordon. Gordon said the man was shot six times, with two bullets hitting him in the head. The murder is under investigation and no arrests have been made, said Joni. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
