	     Tunis - Two Molotov cocktails have been thrown at a synagogue on the Tunisian island of Djerba, setting fire to the building. The president of Djerba's Jewish community, Perez Trabelsi, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the attack was perpetrated by two people on a motorbike. He said the synagogue suffered no damage. "The perpetrators want to sow dissension between Jewish and Muslim communities living in harmony on the island for many years," Trabelsi said. A reporter at the scene told the AP the synagogue was empty and the fire was quickly extinguished. The reporter couldn't be identified in accordance with her company's policy. Djerba is home to Tunisia's main Jewish community. The 2 500-year-old Ghriba synagogue, which was targeted in a 2002 extremist attack, is located on the island. Tuesday's fire was at a smaller prayer site. In recent days, violent protests over price hikes have left one person dead and raised fears of broader unrest in the country that was the birthplace of the Arab Spring. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
