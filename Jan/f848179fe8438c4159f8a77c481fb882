Judge Bill Prinsloo has found in favour of Hoërskool Overvaal in that the school does not have the capacity to admit the additional learners. "The instruction by the District Director of Sedibeng East, to place further learners for enrolment is set aside," said Prinsloo. "I find that on the probabilities that the school has no capacity to receive the 55 English learners, let alone of such short notice and convert to a dual medium school." He further said the District Director and perhaps Head of department and MEC Panyaza Lesufi acted in conflict with the constitutional principal of legality, and that the decision to admit the additional learners was unlawful.
