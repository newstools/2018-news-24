	     Cape Town - A 17-year-old boy drowned on Tuesday morning in the sea at Melkbosstrand, outside Cape Town. ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene and found lifeguards and members of the National Sea Rescue Institute attending to the boy. ER24's Russell Meiring told News24 that, although details were still unclear, it is alleged that the boy had been swimming with a family member when he lost control in the water. Two members of the public pulled him out of the water and officials conducted CPR on him, Meiring said. He was later transported to a nearby hospital for further, urgent treatment. However, he was could not be resuscitated and was pronounced dead. In a separate incident, an 8-year-old girl drowned on Tuesday afternoon in the Eastern Cape town of Mthatha while she was swimming with her cousins by Mthatha dam, police said. The child, along with the cousins, was allegedly under the supervision of an aunt who could not help rescue the minor as the water was too deep, police spokesperson Captain Dineo Koena said. "The name of the deceased is still withheld until her next of kin have been notified. Mthatha SAPS would like to warn those visiting the dam not to swim as it is deep and...there are no lifesavers around it," she said. An inquest docket has been opened. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
