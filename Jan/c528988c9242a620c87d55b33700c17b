Sharon Seudat (SOO'-dat) was sentenced on Monday in court in Mineola, crying while she voiced her regret for her actions. Newsday reports the 22-year-old could have faced 25 years to life in prison if she were convicted of murder at trial. She instead pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter. Seudat previously admitted that in March 2016 she wrapped the newborn in sheets and blankets, placed her hand over the baby's mouth and then put her body in a garbage bag. Police found the baby's body on the back deck of Seudat's home in Glen Head. She faces five years of post-release supervision after her prison sentence.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
