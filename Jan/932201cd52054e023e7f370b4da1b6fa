Sami Annan's early Saturday video statement released on his official Facebook page came hours after President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi declared his bid to run for a second four-year term. He urged civil and military institutions against "unconstitutionally" siding with a president "who may leave his office." Annan said he formed a presidential team that would include Egypt's former top auditor Hisham Genena, who was sacked by al-Sisi in 2016. Annan also said he is running to "save the Egyptian state" from what he described as "wrong policies." Other presidential hopefuls include a prominent rights lawyer who has alleged harassment by the authorities. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
