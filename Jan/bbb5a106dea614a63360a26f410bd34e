	     As the City of Cape Town tries to manage a crippling drought, the latest dam levels reports suggests "Day Zero" has once again been moved forward a week to April 22, from the last predicted date of April 29.  This live broadcast over Theewaterskloof Dam shows the desperate state of Cape Town's largest reservoir. Watch below.  Ray de Vries from Airwater, who is shooting the drone footage below, is projecting that Theewaterskloof Dam - the dam that contains almost half of Cape Town's water supply - will dry up completely on 14 February 2018.With dam levels at an average of 29% of capacity, drilling equipment will start arriving this week to extract water from aquifers on the Cape Flats and the Table Mountain aquifers, in addition to extraction already underway in Atlantis on the West Coast - according to the City. This followed surveys of the areas last year which confirmed availability of water there. The Cape Flats aquifer is expected to produce an extra 80 million litres per day, the Table Mountain aquifer, 40 million litres per day, and Atlantis, about 30 million litres per day.
