Isaac Mutero from Zimbabwe appeared briefly at Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court last Wednesday facing a charge of being in possession of a protected species. Pangolins are trafficked mainly for their scales, which are believed to treat a variety of health conditions in traditional Chinese medicine, and as a luxury food in Vietnam and China. State prosecutor Rene Padayachee said the state is opposing bail as the accused is facing a very serious charge. The charge sheet indicates that on January 16 at Brookside Mall in Pietermaritzburg, Mutero was allegedly found in possession of a protected species (pangolin) in his backpack without a permit issued in terms of Chapter 7 of Nemba. The case was adjourned to January 30 for bail consideration and for the accused’s attorney to be present. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
