Manatha added that it was believed that the baby girl was dumped on Monday night. Yonela Tukwayo, spokesperson for Walter Sisulu University, said no attempt had been made to hide the foetus after it was dumped. "The foetus was not concealed, it was just found lying there," she said. Tukwayo said a foetus was found dumped in a plastic bag in a similar case on Ibika campus in 2017. "The foetus that was found last year had been concealed in a plastic bag, which we found being [dragged] by a dog. The security wanted to see what the dog was doing and found the foetus," she said. Tukwayo said the university had handed the latest matter over to the police and would rely on them to conduct the investigation. "We haven't heard anything from them as of yet, but we know that no suspects have been arrested," she said.
