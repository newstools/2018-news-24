Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda says she is deeply concerned by a twin car bombing in Benghazi that killed at least 34 people this week and that she is "equally appalled" by images purportedly showing commander Mahmoud al-Warfalli killing 10 people "in what appears to constitute retaliation" near the site of the bombings. The court issued an arrest warrant for al-Warfalli in August 2017 on suspicion of involvement in the killings of 33 people in 2016 and 2017. Bensouda says the "appalling cycle of violence and impunity in Libya cannot be allowed to continue." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
