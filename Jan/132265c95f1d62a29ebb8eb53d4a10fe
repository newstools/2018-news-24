DESPITE an overall increase in fatal crashes on the N3 toll route in 2017 (from 83 in 2016 to 119 between January and December 2017), N3TC has noted a slight improvement in the number of fatalities during the peak holiday season. “Considering the fact that traffic increased exponentially in December, and poor weather conditions were experienced at times, the decrease in the number of fatalities on the N3 Toll Route is significant,” says Con Roux, commercial manager of N3 Toll Concession. A total of 12 fatal crashes were recorded during December 2017 with 17 fatalities. Of the total number of fatal crashes, only one was a pedestrian fatality. During the same period in 2016, 14 fatal crashes were recorded with 22 fatalities, including six pedestrian fatalities. “Compared to 2016, last year was marred by a high number of fatal incidents. During 2017, 165 people lost their lives compared to 111 in 2016. The number of pedestrian fatalities were also higher in 2017 at 35 compared to 29 in 2016. It is clear that people remain vulnerable on our roads. We must remain committed and unwavering in our joint efforts to improve road safety,” says Roux. Fatal crashes impose an immense human and financial burden on society. The impact of the loss of a human life in terms of pain, grief and suffering is incalculable. In 2015, the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) in partnership with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) reported human casualty costs comprised 69,3% of the total road traffic crash cost of R142.95-billion. Fatal crashes constituted 43,4% of the total cost. According to the report, a fatal crash costs the SA economy as much as R5.4 million, while a “damage only” crash costs an average of R48 500. “N3TC remains concerned about the severity of crashes on the N3 toll route, which often involves only single vehicles. A recent single light vehicle crash appears to have been caused by a tyre blow-out which resulted in three fatalities. During the December holiday season, 18 public transport vehicles were involved in crashes. Considering that public transport vehicles carry the most precious goods – human lives – this high number is extremely disturbing,“ says Roux. The main types of crashes recorded on the N3 Toll Route from January to December 2017, included: • vehicles leaving the road (26.1% of crashes); • vehicles rolling (22.3% of crashes); and • head or tail collisions, both moving and stationary vehicles (13.6% of crashes) “N3TC wishes to extend its appreciation to the sterling efforts made by the emergency services, law enforcement officers and numerous volunteers throughout the holiday season to support and enhance safety on the N3 toll route. However, road safety cannot only be the responsibility of law enforcement- and road and traffic management agencies. Every driver and every passenger should make it their business to make our roads safe. “High risk behaviour on our roads is totally unacceptable and civil society should not condone or tolerate this,” says Roux. - Supplied 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
