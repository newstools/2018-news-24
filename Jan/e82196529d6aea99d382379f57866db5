In the security for costs application, the parties say Zuma's appeal against the judgment that held him personally liable "amounts to an abuse of the process of the court". "The review application which formed the subject matter and merits of the judgment sought to be appealed against, was itself vexatious, reckless and [an] abuse of the court process," the papers state. On December 13, a full Bench of the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria unanimously found that Zuma's review application of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's recommendations on alleged state capture was ill advised and reckless. Zuma wanted the court to set aside the remedial actions in Madonsela's State of Capture report, which also called for Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to choose the judge to oversee the commission of inquiry into state capture. The facts speak for the president's clearly unreasonable stance, said Mlambo. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
