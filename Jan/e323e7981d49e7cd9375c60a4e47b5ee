No one was injured. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) is to investigate the incident. Acting provincial police commissioner Major General Tholie Afonso said they would intensify deployments to make sure that everyone at the airport feels safe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
