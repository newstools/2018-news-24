The complaints aired on Wednesday suggest Khaled Ali is struggling to secure the 25 000 signatures necessary to challenge President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, who is widely expected to run for and win a second four-year term. Alternatively, a presidential hopeful could secure the backing of 20 elected lawmakers. But the overwhelming majority of the chamber's 596 members already have pledged their support to al-Sisi, who has yet to formally announce his candidacy. Ali told reporters on Wednesday that "the battle for the recommendations is the real battle in this election." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
