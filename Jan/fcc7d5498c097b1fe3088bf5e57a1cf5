Watch. WATCH Johannesburg - A second Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) train was derailed between Pretoria and Germiston in Gauteng on Wednesday. The train was derailed after clamps were stolen that keep the track attached to the sleepers, according to United National Transport Union (UNTU) general secretary Steve Harris. "Fortunately, nobody was injured. We are very grateful for that, but it could have been fatal to both the train crew and commuters," said Harris. This incident comes only eight days after two trains collided at the train station in Geldenhuys, Germiston where at least 200 commuters were injured. Another train crash claimed the lives of 19 people in Kroonstad on January 5, 2018.
