The European Space Agency says it has teamed up with China's National Space Centre to conduct ground tests on two complementary devices designed to deliver high-resolution images from an orbit of 36 000km. The agency said on Wednesday that if the tests are successful, the next stage would be a space mission. It is the first time Europe and China have worked together to test and build an instrument. Current satellite systems are unable to gather the temperature and humidity data needed to accurately monitor storms. The tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific, known as typhoons, pose a serious threat to China and other countries in the region each year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
