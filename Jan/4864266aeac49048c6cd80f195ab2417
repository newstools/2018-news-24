Since level 6B restrictions were announced there has been an unprecedented spike in the sale of bottled water as Capetonians scramble to stock up on much needed water. Many supermarket chains are trying to meet the need with specials on bulk bottled water, as citizens feel the pressure to prepare themselves for the day the taps run dry in the Mother City. A dramatic video of the rush in one shop has been shared more than 2 000 times on Facebook. As a result of the rush some shops are limiting the number of bottles a customer can buy at one time in order to ensure that there’s enough for everyone. A member of a water-saving group on Facebook wrote that he had to pay about R20 more for a box of four 5-litre bottles of water at another shop after the first shop he went to was out of stock. People also shared pictures of the phenomenon on social media.      #H2OQueue at #Makro this morning...#CapeTown#waterpic.twitter.com/RIsMsQkItU — Lionel Broes (@mogwaai) January 27, 2018  People in water Q in Makro in Cape Town yesterday.
