All of the airline's international departures from Houari Boumediene airport took off although some domestic services had yet to leave after hours of delay, the airport's website said. Cabin crew trade union SNPNCA said its members had returned to work in response to a court order ruling the strike illegal because the statutory notice of 21 days had not been given. "We are not law-breakers. We suspended the strike because of the court ruling," SNPNCA spokesperson Karim Ourad told AFP. But he added that the union would give notice of a new strike for three weeks' time and would take additional wildcat action in the meantime. "We are going to stage rolling strikes from next week if Air Algerie management do not reopen talks with us," he said. Monday's action grounded all but two Air Algerie international departures from Algiers and caused major disruption to flights from other Algerian airports. The union is demanding the restoration of a pay rise schedule agreed in January last year but withdrawn the following month after a change of management. The airline said it had been unable to raise salaries due to financial difficulties which left six planes grounded last month because the company could not afford spare parts. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
