Philippi police arrested a 24-year-old man in connection with the murder of a teenager last weekend. Philippi police spokesperson, Captain Lance Goliath, says that the man finds himself behind bars facing a charge of murdering the 18-year-old youth, who was stabbed in Jakes Gerwel Drive on Saturday evening, later succumbing to his injuries in hospital. “Good investigative skills led Philippi police’s Detective Constable Sicelo Gxagxisa to swiftly follow up on all leads so as to bring the perpetrator to book. “On Wednesday, at about 11:00, Gxagxisa arrested the 24-year-old suspect for murder at a residence in Isiqalo informal settlement in Philippi,” confirms Goliath. The suspect has appeared in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on a charge of murder. Philippi Police Station Commander, Colonel Dennis Abels, has condemned the ­killing. “Police will continue to maintain a zero tolerance approach towards crime and the perpetrators thereof,” says Abels. Abels is further urging the community of Hanover Park to come forward with information on crime and the perpetrators. “The police have a reward system whereby good money is being rewarded for positive information supplied to police about crime which results in the successful arrest and prosecution of criminals. All information will be treated as highly confidential,” says Goliath. Sector commanders can be contacted at the following numbers: .
