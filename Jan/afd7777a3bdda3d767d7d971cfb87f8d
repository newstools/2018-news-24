	     Cape Town - The case against a Milnerton man, who faces charges involving human trafficking, has been postponed. Chibuike Innocent Nwosu, 39, made a brief appearance in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday, following his arrest last Thursday. Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said Nwosu was nabbed while they were following up on information regarding an apparent human trafficking case in a multidisciplinary operation. "The raid resulted in two female victims, both aged 22, being freed and taken to a place of safety," he said. "The victims had allegedly been forced to work as sex workers after they were reportedly lured from Mpumalanga and [the] Free State respectively in 2017, with offers of employment." The case was postponed to January 15 when the man, who is in custody, is expected to apply for bail. The investigation continues, Ramovha added.
