Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the three people, aged between 23 and 28, were arrested following a brutal attack on two other men earlier this month. The two victims were kidnapped from Mokhurumela village, outside Senwabarana, after which they were hacked with sharp objects and left for dead in the bush. "They were discovered by a passerby and police were summoned. Unfortunately one of the kidnapped victims passed on two days later after [being admitted to] hospital and the other survived with serious injuries," Mojapelo said. He said a combined effort from various police teams led to the arrest of the two men at the compound of a local pastor. They will appear in court soon on charges of kidnapping, murder and attempted murder. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has warned people not to take the law into their own hands. "We are aware about the accusations levelled against the local pastor by the local community. We urge all those affected in this incident to give us an opportunity to conduct proper investigations. If there is anyone who participates in acts of mob justice, surely they will be dealt with accordingly," Ledwaba said.
