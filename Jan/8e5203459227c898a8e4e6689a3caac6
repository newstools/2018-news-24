	     Cape Town - Two suspects appeared in the Uniondale Magistrate’s Court on Friday for allegedly dealing drugs after 825kg of dagga was discovered in their vehicle. Booysen Sibeko, 51, and Melikhaya Gladmore Mkokeli, 57, were arrested on Wednesday when an intelligence operation uncovered 23 bags of dagga in their vehicle, Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha told News24. A team comprising the Hawks Serious Crimes Unit, Oudtshoorn Crime Intelligence and local police followed up on information about a suspicious van towing a trailer, according to a statement. The team arrested Sibeko and Mkokeli when their vehicle was stopped and searched on a road between Uniondale and Joubertina. "The confiscated dagga has an estimated street value of approximately R1.1 million," said Ramovha. The two suspects, originally from Port Elizabeth, were detained and their vehicle was impounded. Their bail application is set to go ahead on Monday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
