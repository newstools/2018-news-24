The awards event, which was on Friday evening, recognise and reward "outstanding performance, exceptional devotion to community relations and extraordinary courage" within the South African Police Service. This year's awards boasted 30 categories, which included five special categories awarded by the Minister of Police, Fikile Mbalula and the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service General Khehla Sitole. Colonel David Mahlaola, 57, was given the Laureate Award, receiving a new vehicle, sponsored by Old Mutual. Mahlaola, a warrant officer at the time, was followed to his home in Tzaneen by criminals in 1990 and shot six times. He survived the ordeal, but suffered spinal injuries and was paralysed from the waist down. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Mashadi Selepe, said Mahlaola's health had since improved, allowing him to walk with a walking stick. Selepe said despite his injuries, Mahlaola had not been deterred from performing his day-to-day duties as a commissioned officer. Mahlaola said being a police officer was a calling. "I would like to encourage every member in the SAPS to continue to combat crime and make sure criminals do not have a space to operate in our society."
