	     Tzaneen – Two men have been arrested in Tzaneen, Limpopo on two counts of murder and carjacking after they allegedly hijacked and killed a Giyani businessman and his assistant in December. The two men, aged 32 and 53, were arrested on Friday and Sunday after a police manhunt. Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said in a statement that 44-year-old businessman Salim Vali Patel, and his assistant, 31-year-old Victor Baloyi from Noamitoa, were en route to Nwajaheni from Giyani, Limpopo. However, they never made it to their destination. It was later found that their vehicle had been hijacked, he said. "The matter was reported to the police and a joint search operation ensued until their lifeless bodies were found on [December 28] with signs of brutal assault, in the bushes between Morudjie and Mavele villages outside Tzaneen," said Ngoepe. Provincial commissioner, Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba, has commended the Tzaneen cluster team for cracking the case in a short period of time. The two men who were arrested are to appear before the Nkowankowa Magistrate's Court soon. Police investigations continue.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
