NPA spokesperson Luxolo Tyali told News24 that the eight people appeared in the Dutywa Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Tyali said the two women and six men appeared on a charge of abduction. "If investigations reveal that there was trafficking involved, we can always amend the charge. "One of the women is the mother of the 14-year-old girl and one of the men is the person who was going to be her husband," said Tyali. The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) has condemned the practice. "The abducted girl was forced into underage and unlawful marriage," the CGE said in a statement on Tuesday. "In line with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, the CGE respects cultural freedom and choice. However, the abuse of cultural practices and symbols at the expense of women and girl children is totally condemned," said CGE chairperson Lulama Nare. "It is important for South Africans to note that no cultural and religious practices supersede the Constitution and cultural and religious practices should conform and be practised within the ambit of the Constitutional values and ethos." The commission said everybody must be vigilant about the practice and work with the police and the NPA to end it.The CGE encouraged people to report underage forced marriage to 0800 007 709 toll-free. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
