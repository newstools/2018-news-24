special offer on popular chocolate-and-nut spread Nutella has caused a real
rumpus. The price of 950 g jar of Nutella that normally costs about
R66 was slashed by 70 percent to R20,67. According to a Metro
report, shoppers started queueing at stores early in the morning and chaos
erupted after people were allowed to take as many jars of Nutella as they liked. The police were summoned by some stores where people started
“fighting and pushing one another”, BBC reported According to Le Progrès newspaper, one angry employee said: "We
were trying to get in between the customers but they were pushing us." One man left sporting a black eye at this store, where
Nutella stocks sold out within 15 minutes.  Meanwhile Ferrero, the company that manufactures Nutella,
has said on Twitter that Intermarché decided to introduce the special offer on
its own and that the company was unhappy about the “confusion and
disappointment” it’s caused. Twitter was abuzz about the unusual commotion in
supermarkets with many people seeing the humour in the situation.   We wish customers who sustained minor injuries a speedy
recovery. Sources: metro.co.uk, bbc.com    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
