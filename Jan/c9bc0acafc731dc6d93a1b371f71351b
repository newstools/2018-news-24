	     Butterworth - An alleged rapist is to remain behind bars until his formal bail application next week, Eastern Cape police said on Tuesday. The 21-year-old man, who allegedly raped and murdered a 15-year-old girl at Mazizini Location in Butterworth in the Eastern Cape, appeared in the Butterworth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning. "The case of the accused has been postponed to Monday, January 8, for a formal bail application. The accused remained in custody as he was not granted bail," said Captain Jackson Manatha. It is alleged that the rape took place on Wednesday, December 27, at about 22:00.  Manatha said the accused cannot be named until he pleads to the charge of rape. "It is believed that the suspect strangled the victim after raping her, as she had no visible injuries," Manatha said. A passerby found the body of the deceased near Cerhu River the day after the incident.  The speedy investigation by Butterworth police led to the arrest of the suspect, he said. "It is not clear where the suspect was coming from or going to. It is also not clear where the victim was also coming from or going to at the time of the offence." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
