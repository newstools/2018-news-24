Tammy Petersen Cape Town - A prediction of high temperatures for Cape Town on Wednesday has led the South African Weather Service to issue a weather alert, advising that the conditions favour the spread of veld fires, the City of Cape Town said. "Given that we are prone to vegetation fires this time of year and caught in the midst of a drought crisis, we urge the public to please be extremely cautious around open flames and other potentially flammable material," mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services JP Smith said. The predicted temperatures were also likely to cause Capetonians to make their way to the beach. Smith urged bathers to be careful in the water, and only swim in designated areas and obey the instructions of lifeguards and law enforcement officers. - Weather update: Severe weather conditions across SA By Monday, 14 people had drowned along the cityâ€™s coast since December 1, after a 63-year-old man was declared dead at Kalk Bay Harbour on Sunday.
