	     Johannesburg – A road has been closed after a chemical spill in the Kranskop area near Wellington, the Western Cape government said. The R44 in the direction of Soetendal had been closed as a precautionary measure, said provincial environmental affairs spokesperson James Styan. "The concern is the potential for a gas cloud that may form. Wind patterns indicate the cloud may move into the Groenberg Valley direction," he said.
