Mxolisi Mngadi Christmas celebrations turned into disaster when 81 families watched their homes burn in Valhalla Park, Cape Town, on Tuesday morning. Aid organisations are assisting the residents to rebuild their lives. Durban â€“ A 55-year-old woman and her one-year-old grandchild died when their home caught fire in the early hours of New Year's Day in KwaMashu, north of Durban. A neighbour, who asked not to be named, believed that a lit candle had caused the fire. She said the house has no electricity and water, which was why a candle was lit. It was believed that the grandmother's relative locked her and the child inside the house before going out with friends. "Their bodies were not burnt when they were found," she said. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said the incident took place at about 01:00 on Monday morning at a house on Delikhulu Road, in the township's D section. "The house caught fire and two people who were inside the house died," she said. Mbhele said the circumstances surrounding the incident were being investigated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
