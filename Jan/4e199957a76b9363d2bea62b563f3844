Paris â€“ The discovery of 13 malnourished children allegedly held captive by their parents in California has brought back memories of previous kidnapping horrors. Here are some other infamous cases that have made global headlines in recent years: Locked up by relatives Britain: A Maoist cult leader, who brainwashed and raped followers in his London commune, kept his own daughter imprisoned for three decades before she escaped in 2013. Aravindan Balakrishnan, 75, was jailed in 2016 for 23 years. His daughter Katy Morgan-Davies was aged 30 when she escaped, fearing death. Austria: Elisabeth Fritzl was imprisoned and raped over 24 years by her father Josef Fritzl, who kept her in the cellar of their family home west of Vienna until 2008. The case came to light when one of the seven children she bore became ill and had to be hospitalised. Found guilty of murder for the death of one of Elisabeth's babies as well as incest, sequestration, grievous assault and 3 000 instances of rape, Josef Fritzl was jailed in 2009 for life. Italy: Maria Monaco was set free in 2008 after being locked in by her family for 18 years. Police found her, aged 47, living in "horrendous hygiene conditions" in a rural home north of Naples. She had been held since 1990 when her family learned she was pregnant and she refused to divulge the name of the father. Japan: A couple was arrested in 2017 for imprisoning their daughter in Osaka for more than 15 years before she froze to death aged 33.

Abducted United States: Jaycee Dugard was kidnapped as an 11-year-old while on her way to school in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991.
