THE police in the Umgungundlovu North Cluster are seeing an increase in fraud cases where vehicles are advertised in newspapers and online. KZN SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the sales are fraudulent and innocent victims are falling prey to these advertisements and are depositing money into accounts that fraudsters have set up without viewing the vehicles or establishing the legitimacy of the sale. “In a recent case, a victim deposited R13 800 into an account for a Toyota Run-X that was advertised. When the vehicle was not delivered to her she made inquiries and realised the company did not exist and the sale was fraudulent,” Zwane said. He said the police are appealing to the community to be cautious when purchasing items advertised on the internet or in newspapers. “The authenticity of the sales must be verified before making any payments and payments can only be exchanged with the item during the trade. “Victims are often put under pressure to deposit the money immediately by being told there are several offers for the vehicle and that the item will no longer be available. Out of desperation to buy the item, they fall prey to fraudsters,” Zwane said. Anyone who has been a victim of the similar modus operandi is requested to contact the local SAPS or the Crime Stop on 08600 10111. - Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
