In televised comments on Monday, President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said Egypt's strategic choice is not to go to war. "I am saying this as a clear message to our brothers in Sudan and Ethiopia." Egypt has expressed mounting alarm over a soon-to-be-completed dam in Ethiopia that Cairo fears could cut into its share of the Nile River, which provides nearly all its freshwater. Sudan has meanwhile revived a longtime border dispute with Egypt. Egypt in turn accuses Sudan of siding with Ethiopia in the dam dispute and conspiring with Qatar and Turkey against it. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
