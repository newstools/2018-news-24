	     Tunis - Tunisia's government says protests over rising food prices appear to be subsiding following days of clashes with police that left one dead and scores injured. Interior Ministry spokesperson Khlifa Chibani said on Friday on Mosaique FM radio that 778 people have been arrested nationwide in the unrest, including 16 religious extremists. He said Thursday night's protests were "limited," suggesting the situation was calming down. But protest organisers called for new gatherings on Friday. European governments warned their citizens about potential rioting on Friday and this weekend, when Tunisia marks seven years since the ouster of President Zine Ben Abidine Ben Ali. The protests are prompting fears of a new political crisis in the country that inspired the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
