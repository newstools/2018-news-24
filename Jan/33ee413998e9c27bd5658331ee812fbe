Gwala added that surrounding residents gathered and assaulted the suspect before police arrested him, but that no one sustained injuries from the gunshots. Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect was also wanted for a murder committed on Saturday evening, where "34-year-old Khulekani Sigwebela was allegedly shot and killed at Julius Nyerere Avenue", said Gwala.  The suspect will soon appear in court to face charges of murder, attempted murder, and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, appealed to community members to avoid taking the law into their own hands. Residents should instead hand over suspected criminals to the police so that the courts could pass an appropriate sentence in cases of a guilty verdict. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
