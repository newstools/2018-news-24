	     Cairo - An Egyptian court on Thursday overturned a seven-year prison sentence against ex-president Hosni Mubarak's interior minister Habib al-Adly and ordered a retrial on accusations of embezzlement, a judicial official said. Adly's lawyer Fareed al-Deeb told AFP the former minister will be released from jail after the ruling pending the retrial. Adly was sentenced in April 2017 to seven years in prison along with 10 other former officials for embezzling about $122m. On Thursday, the court accepted appeals by the 10 officials and granted them a retrial also, the official said. Adly's iron-fisted command of the country's police helped fuel the 2011 uprising that unseated long-time ruler Mubarak. Under Adly, the interior ministry was accused of practising systematic torture and the repression of dissent. Police arrested Adly in December last year after he had been at large since April to avoid serving the prison sentence. Adly had previously been acquitted on charges of responsibility for the deaths of protesters during the anti-Mubarak uprising. The court also dropped charges against Mubarak, who has since been freed, in that trial. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
