Ntsako Nombelani, Nehawu's national organiser for higher education, told News24 that wage increase negotiations had deadlocked at 6.5%, with the union fighting for a 9% increase. He added that the union wanted contracted workers to be absorbed into the university as permanent employees, so that they would also enjoy benefits and job security. "We are striking for a decent living salary of 12% across the board, but will settle at 9%. Our strike will continue until demands are met," said Nombelani. "We also 'de-Guptarise' council, as there are two council members at Unisa who have been cited in the State of Capture report and the Gupta leaks." Nombelani added that the union would again hold meetings with Unisa on Thursday. University spokesperson Martin Ramotshela could not immediately be reached for comment.
