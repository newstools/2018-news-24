Egypt fears the dam, which is about 60% complete, will significantly reduce its vital share of the Nile's waters. Ethiopia has downplayed those fears and said it needs the dam for its own economic development. A grim-faced President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi emerged from a meeting in Cairo on Thursday with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, saying cooperation between Nile basin countries should not be a zero-sum game. Al-Sisi says Ethiopia has rejected an Egyptian proposal for World Bank experts to mediate the dispute. Egypt depends on the Nile for almost all of its water needs. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
