Hillcrest SAPS communications officer Captain Linzi Smith said that due to the heat during summer, snakes, especially cobras tend to see refuge in cooler places such as homes. SMITH OFFERED SOME SAFETY TIPS: •Avoid leaving windows open for too long. Cobras and mambas can reach heights that are very high. •Avoid leaving your front doors open for fresh air in the evening. These reptiles are absolutely silent. You won’t hear or see them go inside your house. •Before sitting under the tree that has cooling shade, check the branches that there are no snakes lurking in them. •Check your beds and surroundings before you go to bed, cobras are very notorious in hiding under the sheets. •Avoid the age-old trend of liking to chill outside the house, with mattresses, mats and wrappers in the evening. Most reptiles are nocturnal , they hunt at night and are very much effective. •Not only snakes bite you, the human enemy, the centipede (Mosithaphala) is fast and also very venomous. •Clear bushes round your houses. They attract rats and mice which are the favourite snacks of most dangerous snakes. •Buy snake repellent powder and pour it round your compound. You will definitely decrease the chances of a snake ever visiting your home by 90%. “Beware of confronting snakes that get into your homes. Some snakes can be killed easily, others like the black mamba are very cocky. If threatened, they will chase you at an alarming speed and give multiple bites while still on the chase and you might not live to see the next 40 minutes. “So, just be very careful when trying to kill these snakes. Stay well and be safe. It’s snake season. It’s hot and they are highly active and get agitated and angry very fast,” she added.                      - Supplied 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
