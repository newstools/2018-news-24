	     Juba - South Sudan's armed opposition says four government soldiers have been killed in new clashes just outside the capital, Juba. The opposition says soldiers in two vehicles attacked their position on Tuesday morning in Wunu'Lyet, less than 10km from Juba. It's the latest violation of a cease-fire that began December 24 with the hope of calming a civil war that has entered its fifth year. Opposition spokesperson Lam Paul Gabriel calls the fighting "a clear demonstration that (President) Salva Kiir has no intention whatsoever to respect the signed cessation of hostilities." He says two rebels were wounded. Army spokesperson Lual Ruai Koang says he isn't aware of any new fighting. South Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands. Another round of high-level peace talks is scheduled for February. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
