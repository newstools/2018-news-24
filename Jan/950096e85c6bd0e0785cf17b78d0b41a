The striking workers, who are employed under a local sub-contractor through their representative, who did not want to be named, said their employer hasn’t been paying his employees and as a result they stopped working. “As you know if an employer employs­ you there is an agreement that is  reached  about  the  pay  date  and the  amount  of  wages,  but  in  this case it has been the direct opposite,” he said. Local law enforcements were on the scene to monitor the situation as the relevant stakeholders, including the main contractor, project manager the local sub-contractor were locked in a meeting at the KwaDukuza Municipality council chambers in an attempt to resolve the situation. Developer Edison Property Group spokesperson and Co-operate Affairs Executive Brain Mpono said that the issue is in no manner related to EDP. “It’s a dispute between a local sub-contractor that was employed at the KwaDukuza Mall and his staff. “Despite being paid by the main contractor it’s alleged that he did not pay his workers. “The main contractor is assisting to resolve this unfortunate situation,” said Mpono It is unclear what transpired at Friday’s meeting at this stage as numerous attempts were made by the Stanger Weekly to establish contact with the contractor and the on-site project community liaison officer, however, there was no response at the time of going to press. The workers have since returned to work. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
