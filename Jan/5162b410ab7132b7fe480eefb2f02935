Lottering (43), from Hayfields, had to raise R120 000 for her operation in November. She started a fund-rasing drive with her husband Jaun and many people joined and helped. Lottering told Maritzburg Fever her operation went well and she will always be grateful to everyone who contributed to the drive. “I had my first chemotherapy treatment on January 3. It was only then that I realised what the fight against cancer meant. “Everyone who supported me in having the surgery has invested in my life and I intend to make sure I give them my very best when fighting this disease. “I am incredibly grateful for the emotional and financial support of our community. Please know that my life and that of my family’s will be lived walking in the knowledge that we all paid it forward.” Although she eight months of chemo sessions to go, she is positive about the future and her role in assisting those tackling cancer. “I would love to share my experience in my own tongue-in- cheek way, not to make light of this disease, but to demystify and take the sting out of it. “I believe that many patients avoid having an annual mammograms, pap smears, colonoscopies out of fear, but early detection makes cancer treatment more than survivable. It allows people to thrive in spite of their diagnosis.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
