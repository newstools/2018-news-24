Health Ministry spokesperson Omar Matouq said the death toll from Monday's fighting is expected to rise. An airport official told The Associated Press that staffers were evacuated from Matiga airport and that five flights have been canceled. He said state-run airlines received information that the clashes have caused damage to some of the passenger jets inside the airport, but there was no way to confirm the reports. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press. The militias are both allied to the internationally-recognized government. Both are armed with heavy weapons. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
