Sifiso Derrick Mlambo, 33, a branch secretary from Empembeni in Richards Bay, was shot dead at about 19:00 on Wednesday night, police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said. "Mlambo was asked by someone to deliver goods at Empembeni area. While offloading the goods, an unknown man opened fire, fatally wounding him," she said. After the shooting, the suspect fled the scene in his getaway vehicle, Mbhele said. "The motive for the attack is unknown at this stage.
