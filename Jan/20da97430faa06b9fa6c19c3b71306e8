Municipal spokesperson, Mthubanzi Mniki urged residents to use water sparingly as critical reservoirs were at 12% capacity. READ: Nelson Mandela Bay residents urged to drop water use to 50 litres a day "This is because overnight recovery to compensate for the previous day's usage could not take place," he said. The electrical problems have been caused due to outages at the Ditchling substation, which has affected large parts of the city’s power network. Some suburbs, including Mill Park, Fairview and Charlo, were reported to have already lost water supply, but this has been attributed to a burst pipe that was being repaired. Mniki urged people to use water sparingly, even if their power came back on. "Even when the electricity comes on it will take a minimum of 24 to 48 hours [for the reservoirs] to recover," he said. The power outage has also affected the Metro’s operational call centre, with many people turning to social media to complain about being unable to get through for information on power outages. Mniki said the city was aware of the problem and electricians were on site to restore power to the call centre. "Customers are encouraged to email complaints to waterleaks@mandelametro.gov.za," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
