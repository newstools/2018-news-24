In his first New Year's speech as president, 40-year-old Macron said the new year will be "crucial" to France, to Europe and to the world. He made a direct address to European citizens, urging them to voice their wishes about what they would like Europe to become. "I deeply believe Europe can become that economic, social, environment-friendly, scientific power that will be able to face China, the United States", he said on Sunday. He also pledged to focus on labour measures to "allow every worker to earn more", in a country affected for years by high unemployment and economic stagnation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
