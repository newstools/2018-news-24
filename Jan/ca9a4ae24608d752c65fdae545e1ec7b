	     KwaZulu-Natal – The partner of the man facing charges of murder following the fatal shooting of a mourner at a funeral last week has been left hospitalised after an attack at her home. Marie Louise Vucher was allegedly attacked on Thursday afternoon by two or three suspects in her home in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands while she was alone at home taking a nap. Captain Gay Ebrahim told News24 on Friday that Vucher was in a stable condition in hospital. Ebrahim said it was too early to speculate on the motive for the attack on the woman who is said to be in her 60s, saying that police investigations are still under way. "It was after 15:00 when an unknown number of assailants entered her home and beat her severely. She sustained facial and head injuries and was hospitalised and treated. She is said to be in a stable condition at a local hospital," said Ebrahim. READ: Case postponed against farmer who allegedly shot mourner Vucher's partner, 66-year-old Edward Philllip Solomon appeared at the New Hanover Magistrate's Court earlier this week on a charge of murder.  He is accused of shooting and killing his 42-year-old employee Mothiwa Ngubane, at Otto's Bluff on Saturday following an altercation at a funeral. Ngubane died on the scene after sustaining gunshot wounds to his upper body. Solomon allegedly fled the scene in his vehicle, but was later arrested and found in possession of two rifles, a toy gun and, a 9mm pistol.
