- A woman believed to be in her early 20s died after she was knocked down by a
vehicle in Potchefstroom on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. Werner Vermaak, ER24 paramedics spokesperson, said their
paramedics arrived at the accident scene on Nelson Mandela Drive at
approximately 16:00. "They found the woman lying
on the middle island. Sadly, there was nothing that paramedics could do for her
and she was declared dead at the scene," Vermaak said. He said a bystander - believed to
be her brother - explained to paramedics that they were walking across the road
when he tried to push her out of the way before the car collided with her. "However, the exact
circumstances surrounding the collision will be investigated by the local
authorities that attended the scene." Two occupants of the vehicle were assessed by paramedics and
they sustained no injuries, added Vermaak. Â  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
