He briefly appeared at the Eshowe Magistrate's Court, where he heard he would remain in custody until January 22 (Monday), said KwaZulu-Natal Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo. He faced charges of murder and attempted murder. Mhlongo said the suspect's name could not be released yet. "We are waiting for the identification parade, then we can release it," he said. Chief Linda Mathonsi, 58, was shot in the head and neck on the evening of December 5, 2016, around 18:00, while travelling with his daughter, 25, who was also shot on the arm, said Mhlongo. They had been travelling in the Chappies area of Sundumbili in Mandeni, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, when a car drove up alongside their car and an occupant began firing at them. The incident took place shortly after Mathonsi had picked his daughter up near a library in the area. "The chief passed away at the scene and his daughter was taken to hospital for medical attention. The suspects fled the scene in their getaway vehicle and a case of murder was opened at Sundumbili police station," Mhlongo said. He said the Hawks Durban Organised Crime unit had arrested the suspect on Friday, January 12. "The case docket was transferred to the Hawks members for thorough investigation. On Friday, the members pounced on the suspect while he was at his place of residence. He was then placed under arrest and charged accordingly," he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
