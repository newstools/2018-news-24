Never pick on a physical characteristic or a difference when disciplining a child. Teaching children to be assertive and boosting every child’s self-confidence will help them deal with bullies. • All schools should have an anti-bullying policy that seeks to protect all children. It is very important that pupils know that all forms of bullying are totally unacceptable within the school. • It is also important to be aware of the needs of a child who is a bully. Bullying behaviour is sometimes a sign that the bully is experiencing problems at home. •Indicate to a bully that their behaviour is unacceptable. In addition, be prepared to work with the bully to help them find alternative ways of behaving. For more information on bullying or if one suspects bullying at school or if counselling is needed, parents should contact the Childline crisis line on 080 005 5555. “I also urge parents to look out for signs of bullying such as if a child always comes home with bruises which he or she can’t say where they got them from, or if a child always wants to be alone, or if a child shows no interest in activities or does not want to go to school. “I advise pupils to report bullying immediately to their teachers or parents before it is too late.” Childline South Africa’s website says bullying gangs often become violent gangs that are involved in crime, so schools need to respond pro-actively to bullying to prevent it becoming gangsterism. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
