	     Cape Town – The murder of Magistrate Victor Mabunda in Bronkhorstspruit should be thoroughly investigated and the suspects "speedily arrested", the Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) said on Friday. Mabunda, 50, was shot four times in his driveway on Wednesday afternoon, on his return from the Cullinan Magistrate's Court. The motive behind the murder is unknown. PSA general manager Ivan Fredericks, in a statement, strongly condemned Mabunda’s murder. "The PSA is dismayed that the life of a person tasked with upholding justice has to end in such a way," Fredericks said. "The PSA would also like to express the union’s sincere condolences to Mr Mabunda’s family and colleagues." On Friday afternoon, Gauteng police spokesperson Lungelo Dlamini said no arrests had been made yet. "There were no witnesses in the incident… only the neighbours heard the gunshots," Dlamini added.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
