	     Mogadishu - A Somali military officer says one Somali soldier has been killed in brief clashes between Somali and Kenyan troops in a border town. Mohamed Ahmed says the Somali soldiers fought on Friday morning with Kenyan soldiers on patrol in Elwak, a town near the Kenyan border. He says the Kenyan soldiers mistook the Somali soldiers for al-Shabaab extremists and that the clashes lasted more than 20 minutes. The Somalia-based al-Shabaab has carried out numerous deadly attacks inside Kenya in recent months. Kenya is one of several regional countries contributing troops to an African Union force in Somalia fighting al-Shabaab. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
