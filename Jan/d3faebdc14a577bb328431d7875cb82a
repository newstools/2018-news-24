	     Cape Town – A 5-year-old boy has drowned in the
Beacon Island Hotel swimming pool in Plettenberg Bay on Saturday evening, the
National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) said. 

 The boy was declared dead shortly after he arrived
at a local hospital after all efforts to resuscitate him were exhausted, NSRI
spokesperson Craig Lambinon said. 

 He said the boy was found by a group of children and
was brought to the surface. 

 Lambinon said thet
NSRI's Plettenberg Bay duty crew went to the scene at about 18:37. "The NSRI medical crew were on the scene in minutes, and an emergency room trauma nurse
from Mediclinic – who was off-duty but at a home nearby and who is also on the
NSRI emergency activation group - also responded to the scene," he said. He said on arrival on the scene, NSRI
medics and the nurse took over CPR from the bystanders, "and CPR
efforts were assisted by a doctor, who was at the hotel at the time, and
joined by Medlife paramedics on their arrival on the
scene".   "With
CPR efforts continuing the child was transported to hospital by ambulance where doctors continued with CPR, but sadly
after all efforts to resuscitate the child were exhausted the child has been
declared deceased," he said. Police have opened an inquest docket, according to Lambinon. He said trauma counsellors attended to the family of the deceased child,
"the mother, believed to be an employee of the hotel, and her daughter,
who was at the pool at the time".  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
