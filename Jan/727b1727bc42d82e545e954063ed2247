	     Durban – KwaZulu-Natal police have warned Uber, Taxify and metered taxi drivers to be on high alert when driving in KwaMashu and surrounding areas. The warning on Wednesday comes after a number of robberies were reported, involving criminals who pretend to be clients wanting transport from restaurants and nightclubs around Durban to the township, police said. Unsuspecting drivers have been robbed of their belongings and vehicles at gunpoint, police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said. "We are appealing to the drivers to be vigilant and take extra precautions when asked to pick up clients," said Mbhele. Mbhele added that, on December 31 at 22:15, a 41-year-old driver was robbed at gunpoint while dropping a passenger in Ndlondo Road in the township's G section. Mbhele said the passenger had paid part of the fare and asked the driver to wait for someone who would pay the difference. "All of a sudden, the complainant was pointed [at] with a firearm. "They took cash as well as his two cellphones and fled the scene," she said. The second incident took place on January 1 at 23:20, she said. "A 24-year-old driver was contacted to pick up a passenger in Phoenix, destined [for] J section, KwaMashu. Upon arrival at the destination, the suspect demanded to be dropped and he pulled a firearm from his back and pointed it at the driver," she said. A second suspect arrived and they demanded the driver's cellphone and took his cash.  "Charges of robbery are being investigated at KwaMashu police station," Mbhele said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
