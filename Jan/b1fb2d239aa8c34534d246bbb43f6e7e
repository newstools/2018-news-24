Town – A man believed to be an Egyptian tourist has been stabbed at least 10
times in an apparent robbery on Noordhoek Beach in Cape Town on Saturday night. Andre van Schalkwyk, spokesperson for Table Mountain Watch, told
News24 that the incident happened at about 20:30 near the Kakapo shipwreck. He said the man was stabilized by
local paramedics and members of neighbourhood watches before he was transported
to hospital. Van Schalkwyk said he was not
sure what the robbers managed to take. "This guy is fighting for
his life now. I really hope that he doesn't succumb to his injuries," he
said. He said more than eight muggings
have occurred on the same beach in less than two months.   "This is one of many
muggings in only a couple of weeks now. An Austrian couple was stabbed in November
and they ended up in hospital. There was also a German tourist who was recently
attacked at the same beach," he said, adding that there were no rangers
from the Table Mountain National Park in the part of the beach where the
attacks take place. Van Schalkwyk said criminals who
target unsuspecting tourists around the beach "have become really
aggressive". "They attack and stab their
victims for their valuables," he said. He said they've raised safety
issues with the authorities numerous times. Van Schalkwyk warned tourist to
stay away from that area. "BnBs and hotels must warn
people about the crime in the area. They know where the hot spots are. They
(tourists) should be warned about these hotspots so that these people's
holidays are not spoiled. Tourists must stay away from the beach," he
said. He said a safety plan must
immediately be put in place in order to curb such crimes around Noordhoek
Beach.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
