They are expected in court soon to face charges of bribery and corruption. This brings to 30 the number of suspects arrested in Limpopo in connection with bribery and corruption since December. In December, 20 people - including traffic officers, licensing officers and their "civilian collaborators" - were arrested in Tzaneen and surrounding areas.
