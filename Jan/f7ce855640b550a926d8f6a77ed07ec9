A sentencing hearing for Dr Salomon Melgen resumes on Wednesday after a four-week hiatus. Melgen was convicted last April of 67 crimes including health care fraud, submitting false claims and falsifying records. US District Judge Kenneth Marra could give the 63-year-old Melgen a life sentence. Prosecutors are asking for 30 years. Melgen's attorneys want no more than 10. Prosecutors said Melgen was the nation's highest-paid Medicare provider for five straight years. Melgen convinced many elderly patients to undergo often painful tests and treatments they didn't need for diseases they didn't have. In a separate case, Melgen is accused of bribing New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
