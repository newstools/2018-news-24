"The City has decided to withdraw its buses by suspending the shift operations for this afternoon. This decision was taken based on reported acts of intimidation aimed at bus drivers around the City and advice by the law enforcement agencies," said the City's spokesperson, Lindela Mashigo, in a statement. It is anticipated that normal operations will resume on Saturday, Mashigo said. "Commuters are advised to make alternative transport arrangements," he said. He said the City regretted the inconvenience caused by the withdrawal of bus operations, "however, the decision was also made to safeguard the Tshwane Bus Service's (TBS) assets and the lives of our drivers as well as [those of] the commuters". "The City of Tshwane will always strive to ensure that a safe, efficient and reliable bus service is always provided to the Tshwane bus commuters."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
