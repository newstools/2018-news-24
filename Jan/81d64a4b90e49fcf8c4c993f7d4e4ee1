	     Yaound - A female suicide bomber blew herself up in a cafe in Cameroon's far north region on Sunday, killing at least one person and wounding 28 others, witnesses told AFP.  Witnesses said the woman entered the cafe at around 07:00 (0600 GMT) before detonating her explosive vest in Bia, a village close to the border with Nigeria.  The area has seen frequent attacks by the Boko Haram jihadist group in recent years.  Those hurt in the blast were taken to a nearby hospital, witnesses said.  Since 2014, when Cameroon began its fight against Boko Haram, the group has killed at least 2 000 civilians and military personnel and kidnapped a thousand more in the country's far north, according to the International Crisis Group. Since the group emerged eight years ago, it has launched attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad - the nations bordering Lake Chad - and caused the deaths of at least 20 000 people and the displacement of more than 2.6 million. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
