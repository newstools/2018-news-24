Reporter THE South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) successfully initiated a test case last month to directly pay about 100 social grant beneficiaries using commercial bank accounts of their choice as part of the January 2018 payment cycle. “With effect from February 1, SASSA will continue to make direct deposits into all beneficiary commercial bank accounts. “SASSA has received and confirmed details of the commercial bank accounts of more than 2 million beneficiaries, who are receiving their social grants through banks,” said SASSA CEO Pearl Bengu. According to Bengu, the 100 beneficiaries’ test case was part of implementing SASSA’s plan to insource social grant payments. The plan will be implemented in an incremental and phased manner leading to a desired future state where SASSA owns, operates and delivers a ‘’one-stop’’ grant administration and payment service. SASSA will continue to pay all beneficiaries who receive their grants at cash paypoints or who use various merchants throughout the country. The SASSA payment card use has been extended until December 31 this year and will be used to access social grants. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
