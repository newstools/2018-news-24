However, a long road to recovery lies ahead for the Dazel family from the West Rand after Martin (34) and Francois (12) disappeared for almost two weeks. The Pink Ladies organisation shared the good news on their Facebook page on Tuesday night. "Martin and Francois Dazel were found safe and unharmed. Let the healing begin," their director Dessie Rechner wrote on the Facebook page. Captain Appel Ernst of the Randfontein police station confirmed to YOU on Wednesday that the missing father and a son were found in Durban. But Apple could not elaborate on how they were tracked down and why they disappeared. Martin and Francois were supposed to catch a bus from Durban to Johannesburg on 7 January but never arrived at their destination. Their family did not hear from either during the two weeks they were gone. "It's wonderful news that they have been found. They arrived safely at their home yesterday," Dessie confirmed. Because a child is involved in the case, there will be further investigation. Dessie says the family will also be given counselling.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
