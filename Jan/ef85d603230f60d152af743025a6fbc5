The Unity Party's executive committee voted on Saturday to expel the 79-year-old president, accusing her of violating the party's constitution by refusing to support Vice President Joseph Boakai in elections. Boakai lost to soccer star George Weah in a December 26 runoff vote. Sirleaf has denied accusations she supported Weah. Information Minister Eugene Nagbe, speaking for the president, on Tuesday said her expulsion from the party was illegal. He said a small fraction of the party's executive committee instituted the action and didn't follow the party constitution. He said Sirleaf will urge the party to reverse its decision to expel her after Weah's inauguration on January 22. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
