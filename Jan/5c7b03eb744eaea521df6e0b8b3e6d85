"The only option available is for us to postpone until tomorrow morning," said Acting Judge Feziwe Renqe. Gift Sibondo was already in the Western Cape High Court, waiting in the dock in his Billabong T-shirt and Nike jacket. On Monday, Renqe found him guilty of the kidnap, rape and murder of the child with whom he claimed to be having a "love relationship".

She was last seen by passersby and a neighbour, slung over his shoulder on Friday, May 29, 2015. Sibondo said he had found her drunk on a soccer field, and had tended to her with a hot towel in his room while she was in this alcohol-induced "faint". Renqe, however, ruled that Jaftha had died because he had severely assaulted her. He had also taken the teen with him to Limpopo and towns in the Western Cape, without her mother's permission, and had had sex with her. She was under 16 and he was in his late twenties at the time.
