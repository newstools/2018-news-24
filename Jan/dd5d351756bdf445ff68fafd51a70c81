Tropical cyclone Ava made landfall on January 5, lashing the eastern part of the African island for 24 hours, with many rivers overflowing, roads cut off and bridges submerged. Twenty-two people are still missing while 161 000 others have been affected following the storms, the National Bureau for Risk and Catastrophe Management (NBRCM) said late Sunday. The toll from Ava stood at 29 dead and 80 000 affected one week ago. Madagascar, one of the world's poorest countries, is regularly hit by cyclones. In March last year, cyclone Enawo killed at least 78 people. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
