	     Pretoria – An urgent application, lodged by Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging, over a Gauteng education department decision forcing it to accept an additional 55 pupils, has been postponed.The school, which is an Afrikaans medium of instruction school, has claimed that it is full and cannot accommodate the 55 pupils. It turned to the court for relief.However, the department has rubbished the claims and said there was evidence which showed that the school has the space and that students were denied places based on their language preference.The school’s governing body filed a lengthy affidavit on Tuesday in which it has replied to the department’s claims.
