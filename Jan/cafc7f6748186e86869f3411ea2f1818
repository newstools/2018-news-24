A court spokesperson told The Associated Press on Thursday that the judge in Medenine ordered the suspects held pending trial. The suspects all are between 19 and 22 years old. The Medenine court spokesperson says early evidence makes authorities think the incident on the island of Djerba wasn't terror-related. It happened during days of protests and rioting across Tunisia last week. Djerba is home to Tunisia's main Jewish community. The 2 500-year-old Ghriba synagogue, which was targeted in a 2002 extremist attack, is located on the island. The fire bombs were thrown at smaller prayer sites. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
