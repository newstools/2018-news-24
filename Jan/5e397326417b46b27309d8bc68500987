video of an apparent shootout that occurred in Elsies River in Cape Town has
emerged on Facebook. The
video, which was posted on Wednesday morning to the News, Accidents, Robberies
& Incidents
Facebook page, shows two men hiding behind a green container just outside a
block of flats. As
the men are hiding, gunshots coming from the other side of the container can be
heard. The two men, who are also armed, then get up to fire back then quickly
return to their hiding place. The
gunshots from the other side of the container can be heard again and the two
men retaliate again. This continues throughout the video. According
to EWN, the Community Policing
Forum (CPF) asked the defence force to intervene in Elsies River due to the increase
in gang warfare in the area. Speaking
to EWN, CPF chairperson Imraahn Mukaddam confirmed that two people had died due
to gang violence last week. Although there’s no indication that the two incidents
were related, it’s clear violence in the area is on the rise. Attempts
to reach the Elsies River Police Station for comment failed. Watch
