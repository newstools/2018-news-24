	     Cape Town – Controversial businessman Nafiz Modack and six
others linked to the underworld and Cape Town nightclub security takeover are
set to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Tuesday for a formal bail
application.  Modack, as well as Colin Booysen - who is the brother of
suspected Sexy Boys gang leader Jerome "Donkie" Booysen - Jacques
Cronje; James de Jager; Ashley Fields; Mathys Visser and Carl Lakay, who were
arrested earlier in December, face extortion charges.  News24 also previously reported that the seven arrests form
part of a broader investigation into underworld activities, including a murder
plot. Modack and his six co-accused previously appeared in the
Cape Town Magistrate's Court on December 18 under a heavy police presence. Read more: Details emerge in underworld extortion case Ahead of the appearances, journalists sitting at the front
of the courtroom were also told to move to the public gallery. A man, linked to the police, used his cellphone to take
photographs of some of those in the public gallery, including relatives of the
suspects. Among the police officers present in court was Major-General
Jeremy Vearey, the head of the Cape Town police cluster. Underworld violence started surging in Cape Town late in
2016 when a new grouping of men, allegedly headed by Modack, started taking
control of nightclub security from a more established grouping. The takeover sparked violence and several shootings. It also
resulted in several recent arrests. Modack and his six co-accused are expected to face
additional criminal charges. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
