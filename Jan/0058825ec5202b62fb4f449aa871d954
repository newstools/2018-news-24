At the time, a vehicle passing by hit the suspect. "We don’t know the circumstances around this. The passerby alerted police at Fountain Circle who responded to the scene, but his details weren’t taken down. So, we don’t know if he has gone to a police station to report the matter or not," Miller said. The suspect has also been hospitalised and is under police guard, while the second suspect escaped on foot, Miller said.
