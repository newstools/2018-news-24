He said that he would like to study Actuarial Science at the University of Cape Town. The teen also thanked Bushbuckridge’s Math Guru, Jerry Mbowane for helping him to improve his math and science marks.  "Mr Mbowane took me in when I needed a mentor and I am glad that my hard work and his wisdom paid off," he said. Mbowane said: "Thalentha is a star and he showed it during our afternoon classes and I am happy for his exciting future."
