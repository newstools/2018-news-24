Khaled Abdel-Hameed tells The Associated Press that the campaign's meeting later on Tuesday would look at "all options," including quitting the race. Egypt's military earlier on Tuesday arrested Annan who was planning to run in the March 26-28 elections against President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, in what appeared to be a calculated move to push him out of the race. With his bid to run now all but dead, Annan becomes the latest in a string of potential competitors to al-Sisi who have dropped out or have been driven out.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
