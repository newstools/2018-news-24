immaculately in a white shirt and grey pants, the man believed to be behind the
kidnapping and murder of 20-year-old Siam Lee is now is police custody. The search for
the suspect came to an end yesterday following the arrest of a 29-year-old man
at his residence in Hillcrest, west of Durban. A private
detective company involved in the case shared an image of the arrest on their
Facebook page. “Yesterday
morning this office directed the SAPS to where the SAPS recovered and seized
the black [Mercedes Benz] Vito that was allegedly used in Siam Lee's abduction. “At 17h00 this
office detained and had arrested a 29-year-old man whom we believe abducted and
murdered Siam Lee. The suspect was residing in Assagay (Outer West). “A GREAT day
for Justice which we pray will prevail at trial. An unlicensed
9mm pistol and cell phone was also recovered. Siam went
missing on January 4 and her charred body was found in a sugarcane field
several days later. “He will be
charged for kidnapping and murder and will appear in court soon,” Colonel
Thembeka Mbele told YOU. “We’d just to
thank the members of the family for not putting pressure on the police up until
the arrest as the police are trained to follow up on information and then
arrest after all investigations have been conducted,” she says. She says
investigations are still in an early phase and while police believe they’ve
apprehended the main suspect, it’s unclear if more arrests will be made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
