Pam Magwaza Have you ever wanted to see ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa in his 'jogging by the beach' wear? Well, today is your lucky day. The Deputy President was spotted at the East London beachfront on Wednesday by businessman, Thami Dickson, who posted the pictures of Ramaphosa on Twitter. "I have just seen #ANC106 President #Ramaphosa taking a morning walk at the East London beachfront, creating some excitement among morning joggers, and he generously took selfies with them. I also joined in the fun," he captioned the Tweet.  In the pictures, the 65-year-old can be seen in shorts, a white T-shirt, red and white Ronald McDonald stripped socks and a pair of red and black sneakers. He graciously took selfies and pictures with people who noticed him.  Even though Ramaphosa might seem to have a lot on his plate right now, one can never be too busy for a stroll on the beachfront. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
