"Ongoing operations to combat crime on the train lines in the province were fruitful in Bishop Lavis last night (Tuesday) when police responded to information they received," said spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana. This followed a tip-off during an operation to stop the rampant theft of cable and equipment that has debilitated part of the city's busy central line. Three men aged 23, 31 and 37 were arrested in possession of the cable and will appear in the Bishop Lavis Magistrate's Court soon on charges related to theft. Police commissioner of the Western Cape Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula encouraged the police to continue protecting the interests of communities and strengthening partnerships. Last week a delegation from Prasa and Metrorail took the media to the section of the route where trains split off in different directions to show the extent of the damage caused by cable theft and vandalism that has brought some services to a halt and caused delays for others. A test train derailed at nearby Netreg station last Thursday morning because parts of the track were stolen and the week before a security guard was killed. Services on the central line were still suspended on Wednesday afternoon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
