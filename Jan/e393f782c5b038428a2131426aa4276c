	     Bloemfontein – A family representative of a woman and her three children, whose bodies were found in a submerged vehicle in the Sterkfontein Dam, said the woman had been having marital problems. On January 6, a Toyota Tazz containing the bodies of Portia Mkhize, 35, and her three sons Kgotso,13, Nyakallo, 8, and Bokang, 5, was discovered by private divers at a resort in the Free State. A separate case of arson has led members of the family to believe that Portia was struggling with marital issues. The family home and a minibus taxi were burnt down before the bodies were discovered, according to family representative Tau Motaung.  "There was a fight between herself and her husband before the house was burned down. She was not happy, but we did not know that this would happen," said Motaung. Portia called her mother before her death, according to Motaung. "Her mother is too shocked to tell us what she said on the phone," he said. The police were alerted, before a private towing company pulled the vehicle from the dam around 13:00, according to a statement.  The bodies were subsequently identified as a family from Lusaka section in Makwane Village, the statement read. Motaung confirms that Portia did not leave a note. Colonel Thandi Mbambo says that an inquest docket has been registered for further investigation. "I cannot comment on speculation, but an investigation is under way," she said. Portia and her children were last seen in the resort on January 5, 2018 at about 21:00. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
