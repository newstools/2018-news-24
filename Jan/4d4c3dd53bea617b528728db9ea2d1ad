baby in a hoax hijacking was sentenced to five years by the Durban Magistrate's
Court on Wednesday. The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of
the child, can be considered suitable for correctional supervision after
serving 10 months in jail, the court found. On Tuesday, News24 reported that the little girl, who is now
11 months old, was removed from her after her arrest in March 2017 and placed
in "crisis care", but in December a Children's Court magistrate
ordered that the child be returned to her under supervision. The mother, who pleaded guilty to charges of fraud,
defeating the ends of justice and making a false report, was parked outside a
shopping centre in Greyville, Durban, when she raised the alarm about the
"abduction" of the baby. She gave several interviews to the media, including a radio
interview, pleading with whoever took her child to please return her safely. She later admitted that she had planned the abduction and that
the baby had been taken by her biological father. The mother told social workers that she had had a brief
affair. When the child was born, questions were raised by her husband and
extended family members about its features. More to follow. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
