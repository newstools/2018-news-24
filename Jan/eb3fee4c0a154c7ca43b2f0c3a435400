"Climate change is a reality," said Ramaphosa, in the interview on Thursday. "If people around the world, specifically South Africa, ever thought that climate change is just a fable or a fiction, we in South Africa as regards Cape Town are now seeing the real effects of climate change.

"But in the immediate term, we've got to make sure that we bring water to the people of Cape Town without any fail."
