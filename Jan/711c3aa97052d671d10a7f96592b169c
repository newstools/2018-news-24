"It is over evictions," said spokesperson Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar. Protesters had gathered in Marina Street, off Beyers Naude. ANC ward chairperson Donation Ngobeni said the issue was over the eviction of a group of people who had occupied land and were evicted by the metro police. He said a delegation of housing officials from the Gauteng government visited the area last weekend but some of the affected residents felt they still did not have answers about their future and timelines for promised development. Ngobeni said about 100 people had set up burning barricades on Wednesday afternoon to draw attention to this. Zandspruit is a vast residential area whose establishment began with the building of shacks on what was once agricultural land and smallholdings in Honeydew. It is close to factories, housing estates and townhouse complexes, with Beyers Naude Drive a major route in and out of Johannesburg for people living in that area.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
