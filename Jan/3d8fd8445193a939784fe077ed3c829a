Three workers were working in the trench when it caved in, burying them under soil on Monday. They had been working on a construction site for a new mall, spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda said. "It is alleged that other colleagues tried to help the trapped workers, but only two were rescued alive. The third worker was certified dead at the scene." The other two workers who were trapped in the trench suffered injuries and are recovering in hospital. An inquest into the worker's death has been opened. "The question of whether the worker was wearing adequate safety gear and whether there was proper safety protocol will form part of the investigation," Netshiunda said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
