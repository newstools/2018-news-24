President Joseph Kabila on Friday called the Central African country's electoral process "firmly engaged" despite a long-delayed vote, and declared that his country was not for sale. Congolese security forces killed at least six people and injured 68 others on Sunday as thousands of demonstrators held nationwide protests calling for Kabila, whose mandate ended in late 2016, to step down. The United Nations says excessive force was used. The UN this week also blamed Congolese "state agents" for 1 176 extrajudicial killings last year. Kabila criticised the UN for its slow humanitarian response to deadly violence in the Kasai region. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
