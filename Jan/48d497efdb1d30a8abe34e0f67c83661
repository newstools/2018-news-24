to become president that include surviving a bout of poisoning and skipping the
country in fear of your life. The 75-year-old president was speaking to Zimbabweans living
in Namibia, which he visited on Monday. In the light-hearted comments Mnangagwa made it clear that
aiming for the top job can be hard, if not life-threatening. "First you need to be poisoned and you need to survive the
poisoning," Mnangagwa said, in quotes carried by the state-run Herald. "Next,
you need to become a border jumper. Thirdly, you need people like (Sibusiso)
Moyo somewhere," he added. Mnangagwa suffered poisoning at a rally organised in support
of former president Robert Mugabe and his wife Grace in August. Mnangagwa’s supporters said at the time
he had been deliberately poisoned by ice-cream from Grace Mugabe’s dairy, a
claim that infuriated the former first family. After Mnangagwa was sacked by
Mugabe on November 6, the former vice president skipped the country to
neighbouring Mozambique, partly on foot and was ridiculed as a border jumper by
Grace Mugabe’s political allies. Mnangagwa, who claimed there had been plans to
eliminate him in Zimbabwe, later flew to South Africa, where he stayed until
his return to Harare to take over the reins of power from Mugabe. The president’s reference to Sibusiso Moyo, who is now the
foreign minister, refers to Moyo’s now-famous role as the army officer who
announced the military takeover on state ZBC TV on November 15. He said the
army was only targeting "criminals" around Mugabe, who stepped down a week
later. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
