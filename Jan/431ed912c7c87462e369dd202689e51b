Andile Sithole KZN MEC for Transport Mxolisi Kaunda formed a special tactical team to probe the recent road rock-throwing that have been reported on the N2 bridge in the north-bound lane coming from Tongaat to Ballito. Spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane told the Weekly the team met on Tuesday, January 9 in bid to come up with a solution to deal with the matter.

The newly-formed team comprises experienced officers from eThekwini Metro, KwaDukuza Traffic Department, Sanral and Road Traffic Management Corporation. We hope the team will work hard with the police to curb these incidents,” Ncalane said. Six children, aged between 13 and 15, who were taken in by the police for questioning in connection with the incidents, could not be linked to the crimes. Tongaat SAPS spokesperson Captain Patrick Ngwane said the matter was under investigation. “No arrests have been made so far. “Those boys [taken in for questioning] happened to be in the vicinity when Crime Prevention members were patrolling the area. They were questioned, not arrested and the police could not connect them to the crimes that have been reported in the area.” Ngwane said the police are working around the clock to          arrest the perpetrators of   crime. “More police have been deployed to conduct patrols in the vicinity­ of the N2 bridge.” More police have been deployed to conduct patrols in the vicinity­ of the N2 bridge 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
