The school, boasting 220 learners, makes use of basins to wash their hands. The water is changed at intervals. The “dirty” water is then reused to water the school garden. For drinking, every class has its own bucket and a cup is used to ensure no drop goes to waste. Principal Martie de Beer says it is important that everyone at the school understands the seriousness of water scarcity. “We are preaching the message every day for the learners to internalise the severity of the drought and for them to be key participants in saving water. “One tends to not realise how much water goes to waste when hands are washed using running water from the tap, especially where children are involved.” Kouga Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen praises the school for their efforts and says there is a lesson to be learned. “The situation requires all of us to make a conscious effort to save water as we are moving into a critical phase of water scarcity, and we do not know when the much needed rains will fall,” says Van Lingen. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
