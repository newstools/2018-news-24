The US-based group says in its annual report on Thursday that most of the over 200 000 migrants and asylum seekers who reached Europe last year by sea departed from Libya, where they face beatings, extortion, sexual violence, and forced labour at the hands of armed groups. Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East director for the New York-based rights group, says "the migration crisis in the central Mediterranean shows the rest of the world that it is ignoring Libya's human rights disaster at its own peril." Libya descended into chaos following the 2011 uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
