Chibuike Innocent Nwosu’s bail application was postponed by the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on Monday. His lawyer, Advocate Bathya Monyemoratho, argued that the State needed to ascertain the accused’s status as a foreigner should they wish to prove that he is a flight risk. Magistrate Joe Magwele postponed the case until 12 March for a formal bail application to allow for the State to investigate further. Nwosu was arrested after the Hawks conducted a raid in Milnerton, which resulted in the discovery of two alleged female victims on January 4, 2018. "The victims had allegedly been forced to work as sex workers after they were reportedly lured from Mpumalanga and [the] Free State respectively in 2017, with offers of employment," said Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
