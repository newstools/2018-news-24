Mafolo had related her version of the story to Mthembu, the chief whip's spokesperson, Nonceba Mhlauli, said in a statement on Thursday. "We have full confidence in our justice system and believe that the court process currently underway will afford her an opportunity to clear her name," Mhlauli said. Mafolo appeared in the Schweizer-Reneke Magistrate's Court in the North West on Monday, where she was released on free bail, she said. The 46-year-old Mafolo was arrested on Friday for alleged stock theft, said National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane this week. "She was arrested, together with a male companion by the name of Thabo Freddy Phutiyagae, aged 32," she said. Mjonondwane said, at the time of the arrest, the pair had already booked a kraal for two calves at an auction, called Karoo Ochse, and were in the process of registering them for sale. The calves were allegedly stolen in Schweizer-Reneke during the night on Thursday, January 11, she said. Mjonondwane said the calves had been positively identified by their owner. Mafolo was expected back in court on February 19.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
