The Sun newspaper reported on Saturday that police "rushed on the plane and headed straight for the cockpit. The first officer was cuffed and led away". The newspaper says worried airline workers alerted police before the flight left for Mauritius. Sussex police say a 49-year-old man from west London has been arrested "on suspicion of performing an aviation function when the level of alcohol was over the proscribed limit". The flight departed several hours late from Gatwick after another crew member joined the flight.
