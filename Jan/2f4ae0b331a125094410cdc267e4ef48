Friday was an interesting morning on Plattekloof Road in Cape Town as a truck lost its load of hundreds of bags of toilet paper. The video of the incident was posted by Rob Bezzy on Twitter. In the video, drivers who were passing by immediately began to loot from the piles of toilet paper that were scattered about, while others attempted to move the toilet paper off the road in order to let other cars pass through. Speaking to DRUM, Metro FM’s Rob Beezy said that he received the video from someone on WhatsApp. "I received the video and because I wasn’t there I can’t really say how the load ended up on the N7 highway. "However, from what I can observe, it might have been a double decker truck that must have lost the load while turning on the bend of the highway," he said. He added that the unfortunate thing would be that the toilet paper appears to be one ply.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
