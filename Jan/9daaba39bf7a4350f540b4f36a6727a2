A large group of Kagiso residents made their way into Krugersdorp and set houses alight on Sivewright Street on Thursday, police spokesperson Sergeant Tshepiso Mashele said on Friday. "It is rumoured that these acts of violence emanate from a report of an alleged kidnapped Kagiso female. While the preliminary SAPS investigation was underway the community mobilised, allegedly fuelled by unsupported social media reports." Mashele said the group raided two shops and burnt down two houses on Sivewright Street and one in Luipaard Street. "The Krugersdorp SAPS and emergency services responded to the scene and it was reported that no person was injured during these attacks." Mashele said the apparent victim of the alleged kidnapping was brought to Kagiso police station on Thursday evening after she was found near Chief Mogale in Kagiso. "The lady was taken for medical treatment and the investigation into the kidnapping is still receiving priority attention." Mashele did not confirm details around the alleged kidnapping. West Rand cluster commander Major-General Anna Mateise thanked police for their work. "Vigilantism is not the answer to any situation. We are fortunate that no life was lost due to these senseless acts," she said.
