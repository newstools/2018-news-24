A statement on Friday from the US Africa Command says the strike was carried out on Thursday about 50km northwest of the port city of Kismayo. The statement says no civilians were killed. The US military carried out more than 30 drone strikes last year in the long-chaotic Horn of Africa nation after President Donald Trump approved expanded military efforts against the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab. The extremist group was blamed for the October truck bombing in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, that killed 512 people. A US strike early this month killed two al-Shabaab extremists and destroyed a vehicle carrying explosives, "preventing it from being used against the people in Mogadishu." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
