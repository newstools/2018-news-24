Qedani Mahlangu why did you tortue and kill our loved ones?" @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/uA5IqSkg78 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says she does not know why the licenses were backdated in a doc signed by Selebano. She says she knows that this is forgery and fraudulent, but she was not part of this. She didnt report it, because she wasnt aware that this was done @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni #Moseneke asks why Jacobus issued a license for an NGO in Pta she didn't visit, she says she does not know. A family member says "she was hired to kill. She issued licenses to kill" @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says she didnt see the report for Precious Angels even though she is the one who compiled the license for the facility. She says she went to the NGO when she heard of the deaths @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni a visit on 28 July 2016 to Precious Angels NGO shows that there was a lack of bed space at the facility, but the evidence leader points out that this would have been picked up during a preaudit or formal audit @TeamNews24 Moseneke says Manamela came to the hearings and told the panel that Jacobus signed off the licenses and knew about audits, something Jacobus denies. Moseneke questions why Jacobus comes here and says Manamela signed off on the licenses. #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says she does not know why #Manamela would lie. She says she never received anything from the district @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni she says one of her responsibilities would have been to be part of the construction of the documents, but she wasn't. She says she removed from her core duties by being given other duties to handle by #Manamela @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says she was withdrawn from core functions of NGO administration @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus maintains that she was instructed by #Manamela to break the law because it was an instruction from above @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says to #Moseneke that #Manamela was essentially spearheading the marathon project and she didnt have much say @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/uwPby6I78M #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says they raised concerns with #Manamela, but they were told to follow instructions. #Moseneke asks why she didn't refuse because it was unlawful, and would possibly result in the death of vulnerable people. She says she followed instructions @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni "I feel uncomfortable," Jacobus says she told #Manamela but she was instructed to continue compiling the licenses - she says she received no district reports for these NGOs @TeamNews24 She says it wasn't clear to her what was going on, as it was chaotic. She said she informed Manamela at a meeting in the provincial office that she was not comfortable with the issuing of the licenses. #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says the process she went talked us through of licensing NGOs was not adhered to. She says #Manamela said it's unusual circumstances and she was instructed to deviate from procedure @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says there are people who start NGOs without following the proper procedures @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Justice Dikgang Moseneke interjects to ask Jacobus how long she has worked in mental health. She says 30 years @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Jacobus says district officials report to her with regards to NGOs challenges on a quarterly basis or with immediate effect if urgent @TeamNews24 #LifeEsidimeni Hannah Jacobus - a deputy director overseeing NGOs within Gauteng - takes the stand.

Former MEC Qedani Mahlangu will be here on Monday and again on 24 and 25 Jan. pic.twitter.com/m8TfN3frJ5 Suspended Gauteng director of mental health resigns Suspended Gauteng director of mental health Dr Makgabo Manamela has resigned. Deputy Director General for provincial communication services Thabo Masebe confirmed that Manamelaâ€™s resignation was received on Wednesday afternoon. She resigned with immediate effect. "The resignation simply means she is no longer an employee of [the] provincial government, therefore we will not proceed with a disciplinary hearing against her," he said. Call to criminally charge Selebano, despite his resignation The DA has said the resignation of Dr Barney Selebano, the suspended head of the Gauteng health department, following the Life Esidimeni tragedy was not sufficient. The party has called for Selebano to be criminally charged as well. Selebano was one of a number of health officials identified as being responsible for the transfer of mentally ill patients from Life Esidimeni facilities to a number of unlicensed NGOs. The move resulted in at least 143 deaths. Selebano, who testified at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings in December last year and said he took "accountability", first launched an unsuccessful court bid to challenge a subpoena issued for him to appear before the hearings. Suspended Gauteng health department head resigns The suspended head of the Gauteng department of health, Dr Barney Selebano, has resigned. Gauteng health spokesperson Lesemang Matuka confirmed to News24 on Tuesday that Selebano submitted his resignation letter. "Dr T.E. (Barney) Selebano resigned with immediate effect yesterday, 15th January 2018," Matuka said. A senior Gauteng government official told News24 that since all head of department appointments are done by the premier, Gauteng Premier David Makhura is still considering Selebano's letter of resignation.
