Believing that Afrikaners are evil and the reason for apartheid they want to "stick it to them", as I've read on so many occasions. Racism is not going away in a hurry and will probably be here for another 150 years. Perhaps as a first step instead of having Afrikaans as a pass subject they should add an African language to the curriculum from primary school (as I had in my years, we had Zulu) so that our future leaders are multilingual. Somewhere an example must be made that burning schools is unacceptable. Violence as a tool for when you can't get what you want has also got to be condemned and not be accepted.   Leaders in SA need to be serious about education, but they have to be realistic about it as well. There cannot be free higher education. Make primary and secondary education free instead! Time for generalising has to come to an end. Equality is meant for all not just one race or in reverse. But while they pick at wounds this country will never heal. White people can only say "sorry" so many times but they keep whipping a dead donkey here.   Both races are frustrated, both are racist toward the other, both won't back down. Instead of addressing housing, education, equality in the workplace and funneling funds to those causes, government enriched themselves. They are supposed to be servants of the country and shouldn't have luxury vehicles, be paid millions for salaries and they most certainly should not have a God complex that they are untouchable. Leaders should be made examples of when they post racist comments and remarks on social media!  -MyNews24 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
