Jenni Evans Johannesburg -Â The drivers' windows of two Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) officers were smashed during a protest on the K53 in Lenasia, south of Johannesburg on Monday. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the officers' windows were smashed during the protest at about 14:30. The protesters had apparently not been violent since the protest started earlier in the day, but things took a turn when suddenly the two officers' side windows were targeted. The officers were not physically injured. Minnaar said the protest appeared to be over housing, but further details were not immediately available. The protests also caused severe delays for motorists. Minnaar advised motorists to rather use the Golden Highway until the situation normalised. Comment from the SA Police Service was not immediately available. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
