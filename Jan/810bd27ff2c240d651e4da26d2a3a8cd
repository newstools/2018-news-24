Thursday's one-line statement from President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi's office gave no reason why Khaled Fawzi was removed from office. The Egyptian president seldom explains decisions pertaining to national security or foreign relations. The statement says the president's confidante and office director Abbas Kamel, a retired army general who works behind the scenes, would run the agency until a new director is found. Egypt's General Intelligence Directorate is the country's equivalent of the US Central Intelligence Agency, but it has also taken tasks that normally fall under the mandate of a domestic security agency. The agency's chiefs have traditionally hailed from the military. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
