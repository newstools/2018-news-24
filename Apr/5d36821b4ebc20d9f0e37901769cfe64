Once the interpreter arrived, there were issues in setting a postponement date, due to schedule clashes. A new court date was set for June 1. Philippi residents muttered their disapproval as they made their way out of the courtroom. A distraught mother of one of the victims was seen shouting outside the court building as she was consoled by family members. Philippi residents refused to comment as they feared for their safety.
