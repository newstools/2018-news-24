According to Daily News, Mapfumo criticised President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government, saying the removal of Robert Mugabe had only ushered in "cosmetic changes". The legendary outspoken musician also said that the country's future was looking bleak without young people playing a leading role in its affairs. He cautioned Mnangagwa, saying that Zimbabweans were looking for a leader who was not a thief and someone who would stand with them. "These guys are now old and I urge you youngsters to rise and stand up. This is your future, this is your country and do not let them destroy it because you will not have a country. Just unite as a people and rebuild the economy of the country, stand up and say enough is enough," Mapfumo reportedly said. The long time musician said that he was disturbed by the poverty levels in the country. Mapfumo returned home last Wednesday after a decade in self-imposed exile in the United States. He was expected to perform at Glamis Arena in Harare on Saturday, April 28. The southern African nation’s music legend was expected to perform alongside another legend, Oliver Mtukudzi. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
