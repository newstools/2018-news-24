Aishah Cassiem @Aishah_Cassiem Locals are calling on the City of Cape Town to consider the children, elderly and disabled people living at Gatesville flats in Yusuf Gool Boulevard. The call comes after water to the premises was cut off last month, causing a major dispute. Fowzia Veerasamy, ward committee member and Gatesville Neighbourhood Watch chairperson says residents are currently experiencing huge water supply problems and are angry. “All the top floors have no water, the ground floors have warm water in cold water taps, and burst geysers are frequently occurring. The problem started four weeks ago with the putting off and putting on of water, to no water at all,” she explains. “The ward councillor assisted in finding the root of the problem. Thereafter, many residents still experienced water problems even after it was in the media. No water trucks were deployed to alleviate the water crisis since.” Veerasamy says the residents blame the City’s Water and Sanitation Department who only made one phone call to hear if the water was running. “They are the cause of turning our water to low pressure,” she says. People are suffering despite paying their water bills. The disabled and the elderly are the hardest hit. “The water issues open the door to fraud. I beg the City to attend to this issue as we have a huge crisis. About 150 families are suffering now. Ward councillor Aslam Cassiem says the trouble residents have been experiencing is believed to have been the fault of the City’s water pressure department. Contact details were supplied to residents in case the issue persists.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
