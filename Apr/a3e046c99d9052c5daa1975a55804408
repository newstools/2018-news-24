"One of the prolific women leaders our country has had is gone, but will never be forgotten," the ANCWL said in a statement on Monday. "The epitome of the struggle against inequalities, unemployment and poverty is no more," spokesperson Toko Xasa said. The 81-year-old, known as the Mother of the Nation, died on Monday afternoon after a long illness. The Women's League described her as a "selfless fighter of the unjust laws of oppression against the poor and the working class". It said Madikizela-Mandela would remain an embodiment of its values. She would also remain an encouraging figure in the fight against patriarchy and male chauvinism in and outside politics. "She endured physical and emotional torture under the apartheid regime and never thought of quitting the struggle to follow her career as a professional social worker, [and] because of her love of the people, she remained committed to the struggle for better lives for all until her last day on earth. "The struggle could never have been what it became without the undying zeal and passion of Mam' Winnie both for the country and our people."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
