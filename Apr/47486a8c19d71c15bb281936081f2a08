Speaking in Pretoria on Friday, Masisi, who took over from Ian Khama on April 1, said he was in the country to strengthen bilateral relations. It is also in line with the tradition in Southern Africa of visiting countries in the region after assuming office. Commenting on the visit, Ramaphosa said it was about renewing old bonds and friendships and consolidating relations between the two countries. Masisi has already been to Zimbabwe to hold talks with President Emmerson Mnangagwa and is expected to visit Namibia to meet President Hage Geingob. "We have also come to pay our respects to South Africa on the very sad lost of Mama Winnie", Masisi said. He indicated that before he returns to Botswana that he would also visit the home of Madikizela-Mandela, who is set to be buried on Saturday in Johannesburg. The stalwart died on Easter Monday after a long illness. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
