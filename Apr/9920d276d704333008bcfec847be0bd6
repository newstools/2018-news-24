Petrus William Johannesburg Durant is accused of killing tractor driver Aron Mutavhatsindi, 42, in an open field near the informal settlement of Matshelapad, outside Krugersdorp, west of Johannesburg, in January. He was released on R10 000 bail on January 15.

Durant's attorney, Jacques van Heerden, asked the court to amend one of his client's bail conditions. He said Durant had lost "two prospective clients" because he was not allowed to leave Gauteng on short notice and had to notify the investigating officer before he could leave the province.

Van Heerden further placed on record that Durant had tried to open charges of malicious damage to property at the Tarlton police station after two of his vehicles were damaged following the shooting incident in January. He said the police had told Durant that they would not open those dockets. The magistrate said there were other options, including escalating the matter within the police, and that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) would assist if Durant became a complainant in the matter.
