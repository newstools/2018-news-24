Iavan Pijoos Crowds gathered in Orlando Stadium in Soweto for the official national memorial service for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, and the EFF held a separate service in Brandfort, Free State. The ANC is to launch the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Day of Service in Orlando East, Soweto on Thursday. The launch forms part of the 10-day programme celebrating the life of Madikizela-Mandela. It will include the starting up of Winnie Mandela food gardens. "The programme gives expression to the immediate struggle waged by Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela for most of her life, to better the conditions of those that are marginalised in society," the ANC said in a statement. The launch is expected to start at 10:00. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
