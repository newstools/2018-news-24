THE Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Surfriders team claimed the coveted SSA and Sea Harvest 2018 Grommet Games Surfing Cup Award for the team with the most points in the Surfing Division. The event was held at Pollock Beach in Port Elizabeth from March 22 to 26. This was no mean feat considering the event, which was supported by Sport and Recreation SA, presented and run by Surfing South Africa (SSA) and hosted by Nelson Mandela Bay Surfriders, attracted over 120 surfers representing eight districts out of three provinces, Team Manager, Debbie Atkinson, says, “Although we did not have a full team, we still managed to win the surfing shield, which is highly commendable. Our surfers showed the highest calibre of sportsmanship, manners, beach and competition etiquette during what was a very tough week of heat, wind and stress. We are all very proud of their achievement. “Seven members of our team were included in the total of 21 surfers and officials recognised by SSA for their outstanding performances in the games and inducted into the Sea Harvest Grommet Games Stars group.” Coach Jerry van Wyk, was also inducted. The overall win went to Cape Town Surfriders who claimed the Nelson Mandela Bay Trophy for the seventh year in a row. NMB Surfriders came in a close second having narrowly missed first place by just over 200 points. The Games featured eight age divisions for girls and boys with the youngest surfers in the contest competing in the under 8 division and the oldest taking part in the competitive under 16 boys and girls group.
