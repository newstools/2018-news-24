De Lille stirred up controversy on Wednesday when she attended the Economic Freedom Fighters' memorial for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in Brandfort. The DA said it would have preferred to receive a "courtesy call" ahead of her attendance. News24 Political Editor Mahlatse Mahlase is joined by political journalist Tshidi Madia to talk about the top stories of the week: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's final farewell, ANC Youth League president Collen Maine's "confession", and De Lille's next move.
