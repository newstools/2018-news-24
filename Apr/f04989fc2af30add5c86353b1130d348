Of these neonatal cases, 396 had early-onset listeriosis within six days of their birth. The NICD also noted that 37 more cases had been reported since the recall of meat products manufactured by Enterprise Foods on March 4, 2018. However, it said that the number of laboratory-confirmed cases had declined since the recall.

Based on the NICD's monthly report, the death rate has increased from 189 to 191 deaths since the NICD published its previous report in March.
