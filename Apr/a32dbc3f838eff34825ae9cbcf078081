The South African Security Agency (SASSA) “old” cards are still available until 31 December 2018. Grant recipients are however encouraged to swap the old SASSA card for a new one between April 1st to September 30th (2018) at their nearest Post Office, SASSA office or designated venue. Grant recipients may also choose to receive their social grant through their own SASSA account or personal bank account, including Postbank. Cash payments will be phased out in the future. Once the change is effected, recipients no longer have to go to a cash point or merchant to collect the funds. Changes in bank accounts should be brought to the attention of SASSA. For information contact the SASSA call centre on0800 60 10 11. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
