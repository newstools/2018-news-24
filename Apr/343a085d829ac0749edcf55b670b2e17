Human Rights Watch says the campaign has left up to 420 000 residents in northern Sinai in urgent need of humanitarian aid since the operation started in early February. Monday's statement by the New York-based group also urged authorities to provide sufficient food and allow relief organisations to provide resources to address local residents' critical needs.
