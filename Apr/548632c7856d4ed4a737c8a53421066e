Byrone Athman POLICE are currently searching for an unknown woman after she gave birth and dumped her newborn baby in a bush on Noodsberg Road in Mountain Rise on Thursday afternoon. According to Mountain Rise Police spokesperson Gay Ebrahim, two people had been walking by the bush when they heard cries from a baby which appeared to be coming from the bush beside them. “They immediately summoned the police who reported to the scene promptly and also heard the cries that the informants had spoken about,” said Ebrahim. The baby was soon found by the police officers who searched the bushes. An ambulance was then called to the scene to attend to the baby. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring confirmed that paramedics had to cut the baby’s umbilical cord on site where she was made warm and transported to the nearest hospital, Northdale Hospital where she is currently being cared for and monitored. “Paramedics assessed the infant and found that no injuries had been sustained but had to warm her because she was suffering from low body temperature,” said Meiring. Police are alleging that the mother gave birth on the scene and abandoned there because on further investigation of the scene the placenta was found. “The identity of the mother is still unknown and police investigations are underway,” confirmed Ebrahim. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
