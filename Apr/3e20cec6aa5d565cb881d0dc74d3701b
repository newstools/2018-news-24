Christo, 52, and Lizelle Bosman, 46, were woken from their sleep in the early hours of Wednesday by seven or eight robbers, who overpowered and assaulted them, said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Adele Myburgh. "The farmer was quite severely assaulted and stabbed with a sharp instrument. They went through the house and took firearms in the safe and cellphones." They also made off with the farmer's Ford Ranger bakkie. The bakkie was later found about 20km outside of Kuruman. "The husband and wife managed to untie themselves and called neighbours for help." She said no arrests had yet been made. The Northern Cape department of agriculture, land reform and rural development condemned the attack. Reivilo is close to the Northern Cape border. "The department would like to denounce the attack in the strongest possible terms... and is grateful that the couple managed to get assistance and were rushed to the hospital," said Phemelo Manankong. He wished them a speedy recovery and said the department remained optimistic that arrests would soon be made.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
