Thousands of residents were left on the streets along with their belongings and Countesses Avenue was lined with fridges, stoves, couches, washing machines, sound systems and black plastic bags. Talent Tsikayi, who has been living in Windsor East for the past two years, said residents had nowhere else to go. "We saw people from Mafadi [Property Management]. They just came here and took us out [of] our houses. We don't know what is happening." The 28-year-old said she was shocked about the raid, considering that she has been diligently paying rent of R2 000 a month. They moved to Johannesburg from Zimbabwe and she shared the apartment with her husband and two other people. "Now they are saying we are not paying rent. And all our things are outside," Tsikayi said. She added that some of her personal items were missing. "We don't have any plan. We are outside. We [are] just like street kids."  Attorney Greg Vermaak, who was representing Mafadi, said several tenants in various blocks of flats in Windsor East, entered in a rental boycott in May 2017. "There was an entity called the Windsor Community Group Recovery Movement [which] started collecting rental from tenants in other buildings. "We launched various interdicts. After a long time and various court appearances, we were granted the eviction order today (Tuesday)." Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said no violence had been reported. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
