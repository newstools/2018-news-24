From then on, a person in possession of this cloned card is able to make purchases or withdraw cash in the name of the actual account holder.Major General Zodwa Mokoena, provincial head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation in Mpumalanga, welcomed the sentence."We hope this serves as a deterrent to criminals. Patrons are urged to make it difficult for occurrences of card skimming to take place by being vigilant at all times. Always keep an eye on your bank statements for unauthorised transactions, and report these immediately," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
