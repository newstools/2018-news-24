According to New Zimbabwe.com, Mapfumo landed at Robert Gabriel Mugabe international on Wednesday and was expected to perform at Glamis Arena in Harare later this month. The southern African nation’s music legend was expected to perform alongside another legend, Oliver Mtukudzi on April 28. A BBC report quoted Mapfumo recently as saying that he won't be getting involved in politics. "I don't want to be involved in politics I am just here for the people. I
 am here for everyone. I just belong to the poor people, that’s where I 
come from," said Mapfumo. Mapfumo fled the country at the height of political repression. He had not 
set his foot in the southern African country since 2004, when he settled
 in the United States. Jailed by the country's former white rulers over 
his protest music, Mapfumo was later hounded by the black government that 
succeeded them. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
