A collage of photos shared by her granddaughter Zoleka (37) on 30 March show the late struggle veteran at a Good Friday service in Johannesburg. Winnie (81), dressed in a black skirt and red and white blouse, leans on a walking stick as fellow church-goers greet her with hugs and smiles. “I forgot how long the Good Friday service at church is, over 5hrs,” Zoleka – whose mother is Winnie and Nelson Mandela’s youngest daughter, Zindzi – captioned the post. “My Day One and I left the service so hungry, we had to stop and buy roasted corn on the side of the road to eat on route to the house.” “Time for our family lunch aka CHEAT DAY MEAL!!!” she added.

Winnie died after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year, her family said in a statement. "She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon, surrounded by her family and loved ones.” Details of the memorial and funeral services will be realised once they have been finalised.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
