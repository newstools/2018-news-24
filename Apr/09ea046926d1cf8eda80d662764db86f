"The driver was in a critical condition and placed on a manual ventilator before being rushed to a nearby hospital for the further care that he required. "The passenger had sustained serious injuries and was also cut free," he said. Jamieson said four other occupants, who were believed to have been seated in the rear of the vehicle at the time of the accident, had been ejected and were found on the opposite side of the road.
