Prince "Jacquar" Ndlovu, 46, was found guilty of stabbing a 22-year-old student in the shoulder and robbing him of two cellphones, before fleeing to a nearby abandoned building. "This specific abandoned building, occupied by vagrants, [known as] the 'white house', is seen as a crime generator," Sunnyside police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said. He added that Sunnyside police would heighten visibility and intensify operations to reduce crime in the area. Mavimbela said Ndlovu was arrested in July 2016 and has been in police custody since then. The court sentenced him to 15 years in prison of which five years were suspended. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
