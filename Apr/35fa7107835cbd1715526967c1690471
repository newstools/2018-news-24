"She embodies the ANC... How are we going to remember her, because she is an icon?" He encouraged universities and historians to tell her story the right way. "Her contribution is massive, it can never be lost. It ... calls for universities of this country, those who tell history, [to] do it right." Dlamini added that Madikizela-Mandela would expect the ANC and those within the alliance to work towards unity for the country. "This is what she stood for and she died believing in," he added. Dlamini lambasted political leaders who failed to live up to her legacy. "People are selfish. People are consumed about themselves. It's about me, me, me. That has got to stop. We must learn from these leaders. We have got to change." WATCH: 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
