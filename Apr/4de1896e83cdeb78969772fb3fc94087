Mantsoe is facing a charge of premeditated murder in the death of Mokoena, who was killed on April 28, 2017. Mokoena's charred remains were discovered in an open field in Lyndhurst, Johannesburg. The accused has denied killing Mokoena but, during his bail application, he said he had disposed of her body after he came home and found that she had committed suicide. Mantsoe is also charged with assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, for allegedly assaulting Mokoena on March 27, 2017. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Killing was a 'sacrifice' On Tuesday, the court had heard the emotional testimonies of Mokoena's sister and friend. Her sister Bontle, who was the State's second witness, testified that Mantsoe allegedly disclosed to police officials that he burnt Mokoena as a sacrifice for his business. She said the police initially approached her mother at the police station and soon after she heard her screaming. "They (police) told us that Sandile was involved in some businesses and in order for his business to succeed he needed to sacrifice someone, and that sacrifice was Karabo," Bontle said. Puleng Mthethwa, who had been Mokoena's friend since 2014, testified that she witnessed the accused being abusive on several occasions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
