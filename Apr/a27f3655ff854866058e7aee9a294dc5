by scientists for research purposes, the second such killing in a month, a
conservation group says. The elephant was killed on April 12 by a hunter and his
client in a hunting area just outside Gonarezhou National Park, where another
collared bull elephant was shot in similar circumstances on March 7. ‘Significant blow’ A national parks ranger who was monitoring the hunt has been
suspended and the elephant’s ivory confiscated pending the outcome of an
investigation, said the Gonarezhou Conservation Trust (GCT). It called the latest killing “a significant blow to
conservation efforts”. It is not illegal for a hunter to kill an animal with a
collar, though it is deemed unethical. “The (safari) operator was well aware of the ethical stance
and, as a result of previous similar incidences, was aware of the potential for
collared individuals to roam into hunting areas outside the park,” the trust
said in a statement. 11 000 elephants Zimbabwe’s main hunters’ association hasn’t yet commented on
the incident. Zimbabwe's hunting industry was thrust into the spotlight in 2015
after a US hunter shot dead Cecil, a collared lion popular with tourists, after
the animal strayed outside Hwange National Park. GCT says it has collared more than 20 large bull elephants
to monitor their movements and gather data for conservation purposes.
Gonarezhou is said to have around 11 000 elephants, one of the highest
concentrations in Africa. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
