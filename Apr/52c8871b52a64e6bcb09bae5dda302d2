 the 68-year-old vice president missed a chance to appear before the 
Mines and Energy parliamentary portfolio committee investigating the 
alleged loot of diamond revenue. Mohadi also missed the country's independence celebrations on Wednesday. Committee chairperson, Temba Mliswa told legislators that Mohadi was unable to make it for the hearing due to an undisclosed 
illness. "VP
 Mohadi is not feeling well and is outside the country so he will not be
 appearing before the Mines and Energy committee... We 
wish him well," Mliswa was quoted as saying. Mohadi and several other senior government officials, 
including former president Robert Mugabe and his ex-deputy Joice Mujuru 
were expected to appear before the committee. The mines 
committee wanted the former and serving government officials to answer 
questions over  Mugabe's claim two years ago that 
Zimbabwe had lost out on up to $15 billion worth of diamond earnings. The committee had so far heard evidence from top mining executives, as well as former and serving security officials. Mugabe himself told the private Zimbabwe Independent newspaper recently that the figure was not  factual. "I
 was given that (figure) by some officials, that figure had been 
circulating around, but really it was not confirmed; it was just a 
story," he was quoted as saying. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
