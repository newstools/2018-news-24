The group of parents were making their way from Chibok in Borno State to Yola, the capital of Adamawa State, where the majority of the girls who have been released by Boko Haram jihadists are studying at the American University of Nigeria. "We left Chibok this morning in a convoy of seven buses for Yola to visit our daughters at the American University," Yana Galang, from the Abducted Chibok girls Movement for Rescue, told AFP. Halfway between Chibok and Yola, the driver of one of the vehicles lost control after easing the brakes and hit a road maintenance truck, Galang said. "One person died and 17 others were critically injured. Eight of them sustained fractures on hands and legs," she added. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook The kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in April 2014 shocked the world and became a symbol of the abuses comitted by Boko Haram.
