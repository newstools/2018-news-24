Wreaths have been laid at the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Chris Hani.  Jump to
                    bottom IN PICTURES: Chris Hani's Life, Murder And A Bloodied Nation On The Brink Late South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani was assassinated 25 years ago on April 10 1993. Polish truck driver Janusz Walus gunned down Hani outside his Boksburg home on April 10, 1993. Former
 Conservative Party MP Clive Derby-Lewis had conspired to plunge the 
country into a race war and scupper the reconciliation process ahead of 
the country's first democratic elections in 1994, with a series of 
assassinations. #ChrisHani mayor Mzwadile Masina called up & some in SACP colours sing they want state power, a group on the other end in ANC colours also starts making a noise @TeamNews24 Remembering #ChrisHani, a scholar, soldier, disciplinarian & a no nonsense taker. Leaders like him r rare to find these days in SA due to looting era which has engulfed our institutions. Rest In Peace Tshonyane. pic.twitter.com/i8lSt5hImR It will be Mbaks, he is here now https://t.co/vMeZEErarv #ChrisHani crowd singing they don't want the capitalist agenda, someone says this is about Cyril Ramaphosa @teamnews24 pic.twitter.com/AOFLdgteGo An MMC now saying the minister Nathi Mthethwa will be made the keynote speaker. It all just smacks of disrespect, wondering what the SACP makes of all of this, where they aren't even allowed to deliver a keynote address at the commemoration of their own leader's murder?! https://t.co/hQ9nQX3vbj Jump to
