The exchange took place during his visit to Windsor Castle. "She was reminiscing about her relationship with Nelson Mandela, particularly on the year when we celebrate 100 years of his birth," he said after the visit. "She remembered very fondly the discussions she used to have with him. She also gave me two letters that he wrote to her, wonderful pieces of memorabilia." The letters marked South Africa's re-entry to the Commonwealth in 1994, according to the Royal Family's official Twitter account.
