Netwerk24 reports that a man who dragged the infant out of the drain had been stopped by a woman who heard the baby's cries. The baby was seen lying naked about a metre and a half below with the umbilical cord still attached, Netwerk24 reports. When she was removed, the baby was cold and dirty, but residents were on hand to warm her up, using towels, passer-by Cornie Viljoen told Netwerk24. He said he would like to see the baby girl again, so he can hug her and give her the love that she deserves. Paramedics estimate that the baby was about three hours old when she was found. She was rushed to hospital, Herald Live reported. She is reported to be in a stable condition. Police are investigating a case of concealment of birth according to IOL. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
