The attack took place between Kraaifontein and Muldersvlei stations at about 19:35 on Monday after the train malfunctioned and the driver got out of his cab to investigate. According to Metrorail, the driver was attacked by three men who knifed him and robbed him of his possessions. Emergency services responded and the man was taken to a local clinic for treatment before being discharged soon thereafter, regional manager Richard Walker said in a statement. He condemned the incident, describing assaults on employees as "brutal, criminal and unwarranted". "Our employees are instrumental in delivering an essential public service to the thousands of commuters who depend on trains as their primary means of transport," he said. "The attack is totally unacceptable and Metrorail protection services will liaise with provincial SAPS (including the rapid rail response unit) to develop mitigating crime prevention strategies." Walker appealed to any witnesses or anyone with information to report it to the authorities, adding that rewards of up to R25 000 were payable for tips leading to successful convictions.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
