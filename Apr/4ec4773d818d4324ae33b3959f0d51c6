The video starts with two men and a woman who are sitting in a car. The trio then plays with a handgun while filming a live video on the social media platform. As the woman picks up the firearm and points it to the camera, the man sitting next to her steadies her hands and tells her she’s making him nervous. “You’re making me nervous,” the man says, while she continues to play with the gun. A few moments later the woman fires the gun and the bullet lands in the man’s head. Blood can be seen dripping from his head before the video ends. According to Fox News, the incident happened at 02.30 in a parking lot at a Valero gas station in Houston, Texas, over Easter. The site also identified the man as Devyn Holmes, a 26-year-old father of two who is now in a critical condition. The Independent has reported that the woman, Cassandra Damper, has been arrested and charged with tampering or fabricating evidence after wiping the gun and telling the police she didn’t know it was loaded. The third passenger in the car wasn’t arrested, however, a grand jury will determine if there are additional charges filed against Damper and the other man.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
