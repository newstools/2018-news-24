"During a scheduled visit programme to a number of countries, Marshal Haftar felt ill and visited a hospital in Paris for normal checkups," Ahmed al-Mesmari wrote on Twitter. The 75-year-old Haftar "will be back in Libya within few days," he added. Contradictory information about the strongman's health and possible demise had been circulating in Libyan press and on social media this week. Haftar had not made any public appearances recently, fueling the rumours. Some local media even announced his death on Friday, despite repeated denials from his spokesman and relatives. The UN said that their envoy, Ghassan Salame, had spoken to Haftar Friday "and discussed the general situation in Libya and the latest political developments in the country," UNSMIL tweeted. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook Khalifa Haftar "is very well.

Haftar supports an administration based in the east of the country. A UN-backed unity government based in the capital Tripoli has struggled to assert its authority outside the west.
