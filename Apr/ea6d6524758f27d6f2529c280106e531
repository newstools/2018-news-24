SUNA said on Tuesday the chambers are located at a depth of 10 meters under a pyramid in the Meroe area. The Unesco world heritage site is home to pyramids ranging from six meters to 30 meters tall. It says archeologists from a Qatari mission discovered artifacts, including human and animal bones, inside the chambers. The pyramids, with narrow bases and steep angles on the sides, were built by the ancient Nubian civilisation between 720 and 300 BC. Qatar has pledged $135m to renovate and support Sudan's antiquities. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
