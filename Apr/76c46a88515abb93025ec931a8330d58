On Tuesday the court heard testimony from investigating officer Sergeant Marlon Appollis, who had been called out to Spier wine estate in July 2016 for what he thought was a suicide. In the bathroom of a suite lay the body of Susan Rohde, the accused's wife. Her death was thought to have been a suicide. It was believed that she used a curling iron to hang herself from a bathroom door hook.

He continued to investigate the scene. Later, the post mortem report switched the inquest to a murder investigation and Rohde was arrested and charged with murder and obstructing justice. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutor Louis Van Niekerk turned to the report of Captain Simon Mofokeng, from the mechanical and metallurgical engineering section of the police's forensic science laboratory on Tuesday. Appollis had asked him to do tests on the left-hand side hook of the bathroom door, which the cord was tied to, to establish whether the hook could withstand an approximate weight of 51kg. That was when defence lawyer advocate Graham van der Spuy objected on the grounds that he was not provided with sufficient notice of the evidence. The trial was postponed to Thursday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
