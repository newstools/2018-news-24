Boipelo Mere Retailers in and around Kimberley are urged to contact the police with regards to suspected stolen clothes that were confiscated from what seems to be shoplifting syndicates. This request follows the arrest of five females and one male on Tuesday, 6 March, at about 17:30 on the N12, just outside Kimberley in a northern direction. According to Capt. Olebogeng Tawana, police spokesperson, the suspects were travelling in a white Toyota Avanza filled with suspected stolen goods such as clothing, beauÂ­ty products and perfumes. The suspected stolen clothes have an estimated value of R80 000. Some of the clothes still had tagged prices attached to it, identifying the shops it was supposedly stolen from. All the suspects, aged 28 to 60, are from the Jan Kempdorp and Pampierstad areas and made a brief appearance in the Pampierstad Magistrate Court. Retailers can call WO Henk van der Merwe on 082-447-1250. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
