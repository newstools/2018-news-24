Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani said on Wednesday the exhibit displays around 300 artifacts that show the life of the Ptolemaic dynasty that ruled Egypt for some 300 years - from around 320 BC to about 30 BC. A Dominican archaeological mission unearthed the artifacts in the Taposiris Magna area in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. Mission chief Kathleen Martinez tells The Associated Press the artifacts will help solve the mystery surrounding the burial of the Queen Cleopatra, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Egypt hopes such exhibitions and discoveries will spur tourism, partially driven by antiquities sightseeing, which was hit hard by political turmoil following the 2011 uprising. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
