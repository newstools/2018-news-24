Police spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, said the 48-year-old David Rene Roger Bellet-Brissaud, from Gabon, had been reported missing by his wife early on Friday morning. She said police information had Bellet-Brissaud and his wife checking in at their hotel on Thursday afternoon. "After settling in, the couple took a walk on the beachfront and later dined with friends from Gabon who were also participating in the event, at the Boardwalk complex," she said. Naidu said the couple had retired to their room at around 21:00. She said Bellet-Brissaud’s wife had apparently woken up at around 01:00, and noticed he was not in the room.

"He did not take his wallet or cellphone with him," Naidu said. Naidu said the athlete had been wearing a black hoody top with the words 'Adidas' on the sleeves, blue jeans and takkies. "He wears prescription glasses and sports a beard. His hair is slightly long. He does not speak fluent English. "It is the first time that the couple is visiting Port Elizabeth and this would have been his first race," she said.
