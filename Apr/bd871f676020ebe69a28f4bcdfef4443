and arson after the bodies of five people were found inside a burnt house in
Pietermaritzburg. Police spokesperson Sergeant Mthokozisi Ngobese said police
received a phone call about a house on fire at 10 Larch Road between 03:00 and
03:30 on Thursday morning. The residence is situated between the Jika Joe informal
settlement and the Brookside Mall. "After we received a complaint of arson, we went to the
house and when we arrived the house was still on fire. We called the fire
department to assist with the fire," said Ngobese. He said the Jaws of Life had to be used to break the gate
and burglar bars on the front door. "When we entered, we realised that there were bodies of
five people inside. They had all succumbed to their burn injuries." Ngobese identified the deceased as 46-year-old Aziz Manjra,
his wife Amina Essop, also 46, their daughter Mehrunissa Manjra, 14, and their
eight-year-old son, Rizwaan Manjra. A family friend, Zaiboon Valley, 50, was also in the house
when the incident happened. "We are investigating the circumstances surrounding the
matter. At this stage, there is evidence that a petrol bomb may have been
thrown into the house." Ngobese said the police were searching for the suspects and
the motive of the attack was still unknown. "We do not want to speculate anything at the moment,
but we are not ruling out any possibilities," he said when asked if it
could be family members involved in the incident.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
