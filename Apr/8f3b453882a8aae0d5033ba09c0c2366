Allan Monga of Deering High School won the Maine "Poetry Out Loud" contest. He applied for asylum in the US, but hasn't been granted legal residency. He's not being allowed to compete in the National Endowment of the Arts' "Poetry Out Loud" contest next week. The Portland Press Herald reports his lawyer said Wednesday that Monga may not get another chance to compete in the national finals and "show his merit." NEA attorneys say the organization has the right to "draw the line" in deciding who's eligible for its programmes. A judge plans to rule by Friday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
