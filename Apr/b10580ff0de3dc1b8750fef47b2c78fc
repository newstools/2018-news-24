Police have promised a robust response to any demonstrations against President John Magufuli. A protest in February led to the death of a student hit by a stray bullet. Britain and the US issued alerts on Tuesday warning of "possible" protests "across Tanzania" adding that police might use "tear gas and live ammunition". They urged their citizens to avoid crowds and monitor local media. The protest call has circulated on social media in recent weeks, although the likely response to it remains unclear. Thursday coincides with the anniversary of the union of mainland Tanzania and the Zanzibar archipelago that together comprise the United Republic of Tanzania. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
