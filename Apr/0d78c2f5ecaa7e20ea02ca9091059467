                    bottom Malema questions what a mourning period is. It means the
nation is mourning, he says. “What must I do as a South African?” He says a league must be suspended, that is why Kaizer
Chiefs is losing. "We need cultural revolution in South Africa." She wanted to live among the people of Soweto. We don’t even know what the real issues our people are
facing. Mama had a constant interaction with the people of Soweto, she knew
what issues they were facing. She didn’t hear about it in the media. Don’t be wheelbarrows, be thinkers like Winnie.

Mama taught us not to live a lie. Speak your mind, express
yourself but do it with humility. We came here to say thank you, in the presence of the people
of Brandford. Thank you for protecting mama. If it was not for you this freedom would not have been
realised. Women make better soldiers, leaders, they are mothers. Winnie Mandela was a mother.

We ate her food, slept at her house. We know the love from
Winnie Mandela. She was a caring mother who would do anything for her children,
Malema says. She didn't care what came her way. In everything she did, she wanted to protect her children. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: This April we have lost our mother. It is in this very April that 366 years ago marked the colonisation of our people. It is in this very April that Chris Hani was killed. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: We have seen the DA pass what they call the De Lille Clause, similar to the Sobukwe Clause passed by the apartheid government. History has a funny way of repeating itself. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: We must remember that Brandfort is not a suburb, it is a place that the apartheid government used to imprison black people. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: Winnie Mandela was able to provide a clinic for the people even though she was under oppression and yet the ANC government even without anything to fear have failed to provide the people of Brandfort with better healthcare. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: All we ask is that government bring employment opportunities to the people of Brandfort. We ask that they receive shares in the mines that surround them. We ask that they be provided with a clinic. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: Mama Winnie did not want the youths in corners, and yet till today there is no institution of higher learning in this place. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: They could not protect the house that housed our struggle stalwart. Yet, they protect the statue of Paul Kruger. They protect each symbol that reminds us of our struggle and oppression. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: We make no apologies for coming here because we want to give the people of Brandfort a voice. #EFFWinnieMandelaMemorialService Malema: We have come to Brandfort, a place where her legacy was supposed to die. They thought since Mama could not speak Sesotho, they thought she would be rejected. But instead the people of Brandfort also found shelter under this gigantic tree. Jump to
