The elections, which are expected before the end of July, would be the country's first vote without former president Robert Mugabe as one of the presidential candidates. According to BBC, previous elections "were marred by violence as the
police and military were used to intimidate the opposition and keep Mr Mugabe in power". President Emmerson Mnangagwa has vowed to hold fair elections to ensure Zimbabwe "engages the world as a qualified democratic state", a Herald newspaper report said recently. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has put in place a Special Election Force which is meant to create a "peaceful environment" ahead of the watershed polls. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.
