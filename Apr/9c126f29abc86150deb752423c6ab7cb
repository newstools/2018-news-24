Yamkela Ntshongwana  Vuyisile Khabiqheya, 23, has lived his whole life without electricity. He says he has to walk a kilometre, from Phelandaba in the Eastern Cape to Mmangweni, to charge his phone. The small village of Phelandaba, established in 1993, has been waiting for electricity for more than 24 years, GroundUp reported. "Sometimes we fear that we might miss important calls while our phones are on charge, as some of us are still job hunting," said Khabiqheya. "When the sun sets, we see other homes enjoying the privilege of access to lights. But as for us, nothing," he said. Another villager, Nokuphumla Mashiyane, said: "We have not tasted the freedom others are tasting… Our municipality has failed us." Villagers say that their councillor promised that, once the village expanded to 50 households, the Intsika Yethu municipality would bring electricity. Phelandaba now has about 85 households.The municipality has provided water taps, but villagers say electricity is a priority.
