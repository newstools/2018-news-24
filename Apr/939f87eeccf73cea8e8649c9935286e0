her father hurled her from the roof of a shack in Kwadwesi near Port Elizabeth
in the Eastern Cape. According to the South African Police Service (SAPS) Facebook
page, the incident took place during a demolition operation by the Nelson
Mandela Metro Municipality of alleged illegal shacks in the Joe Slovo West area
of Kwadwesi. Attempting to delay the operation, the 38-year-old man
allegedly climbed onto the roof one of the shacks with his one-year-old
daughter. “Due to the dangerous threat to the safety of the child, police set
out a plan to rescue the girl and to arrest the male,” they wrote in their
statement. The SAPS and Metro Police surrounded the structure and a
member of the SAPS attempted to talk the man down while a rescue was attempted.
However, as the police grabbed the man, he threw his child off the roof. “Fortunately, a member of Metro Police caught the girl and
the father was arrested,” they wrote. The Motherwell cluster commander, major general Dawie Rabie,
called the incident “shocking” and said the man would face to full consequences
of his actions. “It is shocking that a father would attempt to sacrifice his
own child for the sake of delaying the demolition of an illegal shack
structure,” he said. The child was returned to her 35-year-old mother, but social
workers will be keeping a close eye on them. The father will be facing
attempted murder charges. See the pictures here:   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
