The She Conquers foundation, which campaigns to improve the lives of adolescent girls, said Nonkanyiso Cono "failed to disclose her relations with Mr Zuma" and had acted "contrary to the principles" that the charity stood for. "As young girls we are lured and used by people with power who use their position to take advantage of us," the group said in a statement.

The former president, who was forced to resign in February after nearly a decade in power, is facing a string of corruption charges stemming from an arms contract dating to before his time in office.
