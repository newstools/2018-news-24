The man, 65, was arrested on a murder charge on Saturday evening after he was discovered with the body near his home, west of Pretoria, said Captain Bonginkosi Msimango. Officers made a grisly discovery when they unwrapped the black plastic cover and found the body had no head. "The head was found in the house," said Msimango. There was no sign of the intestines, and skin was cut off both legs. The deceased's mother had been visiting relatives in Mpumalanga at the time, said Msimango. Police had yet to establish a motive for the 34-year-old's murder but were investigating the possibility it was occult-related.
