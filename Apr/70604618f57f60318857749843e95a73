"Our sector police members were patrolling in the area at about 02:30 (on Thursday) when they received a complaint of a serious domestic violence [incident] where live-in lovers were fighting using knives," said Captain Solomon Sibiya in a statement. Police went to the address and were taken to a shack in the backyard. "A dead body of a woman was found lying in a pool of blood inside the couple's shack. She had sustained multiple stab wounds to the upper body and head." A witness gave an account of the argument in which both used knives to "stab each other repeatedly". The woman, aged 23, was declared dead on the scene and the boyfriend was arrested. He is due to appear in the Kagiso Magistrate's Court soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
