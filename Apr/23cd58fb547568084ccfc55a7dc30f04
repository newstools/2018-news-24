words before he was allegedly shot in the head by his pals, who were playing
around with two handguns in a car parked at a petrol station. According to the New
York Post, Devyn (26) from Houston, Texas is now fighting for his life in
the hospital. The moments leading up to the horrifying
incident were broadcast on Facebook Live on Easter Sunday. Devyn could reportedly be heard telling
someone they were making him nervous in the video. “It ain’t got no clip, bud,” another person
then answered. Moments later, the gun went off, hitting Dewyn. The now-deleted footage also showed him
slumped over and covered in blood, The
Sun reports. “Three people were inside the car while
Devyn and a woman were playing with two handguns. The gun fired, hitting Devyn
in the head,” police told Click2Houston. A woman has since been charged with
tampering with evidence for trying to rub gunshot residue off her hands. The other man in the car was not charged. Sources: Click2Houston,
