A teacher had noticed that a 15-year-old pupil was hiding an item in his pocket at school, and he refused to hand it over, said Captain Nozuko Handile. He was taken to the principal, where he handed over a 9mm magazine with seven rounds of ammunition. Police charged him with unlawful possession of ammunition.

The teenager was charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm. The pair cannot be named because they are minors. They were handed over to their guardians and warned to be in court, which they duly did on Tuesday. Local social workers were enlisted to assist. The case was postponed until May 4. "Investigations will include the ownership of the weapon, how these learners acquired this firearm and whether it had been used in other crimes," said Handile.
