These allegations surfaced during public hearings on the Communal Property Amendment Bill in the province, said acting committee chairperson Pumzile Mnguni. "One of the allegations was that the department is colluding with some politicians to ensure that the rightful beneficiaries do not benefit." One of the stakeholders alleged that government officials held shares or interests in a CPA, while a community asked for a forensic investigation as it believed "billions of rands" had been spent without CPA members knowing. "There is an allegation of the involvement of a senior official in the matters of the CPA, although the management of the CPA was not his responsibility. The committee gave this official an opportunity to respond to these allegations, but was not satisfied with the response." CPAs were created as part of the land reform programme to ensure beneficiaries could acquire, hold and manage property. Mnguni and his committee were on Thursday briefed on the progress of CPAs by the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform. He directed the department to conduct an inquiry into these allegations and report back to the committee. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
