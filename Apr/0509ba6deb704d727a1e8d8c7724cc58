"The suspects, who were apparently dressed in... security uniforms, entered the premises in the morning and allegedly produced what has now been established as false credentials to the staff," spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said. "They were reportedly handed the money and swiftly left the bank." They made off with an undisclosed amount of money. The Hawks urged anyone with information on the whereabouts of the suspects to contact the investigating officer on 071 481 2722 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111 and to send tip-offs anonymously to Crime Line 32211. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
