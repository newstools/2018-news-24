Moremi-Taueatsoala said traffic volumes at the Kranskop Toll Plaza have been seeing an average of around 2500 vehicles per hour, while the Capricorn Toll Plaza had opened its gates to allow vehicles to pass through for free to avoid further congestion. "The traffic at Kranskop Plaza is piling up with a distance of 500 meters away from the plaza… We have been informed that the management at the Capricorn have decided to open up the gates for the southbound in order to avoid further problems," he said. "The traffic volume has gone up on R71 and Boyne and Ga-Maja bypass after the church service of the two ZCC churches in Moria," Moremi-Taueatsoala said.
