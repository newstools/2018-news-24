Hawks spokesperson Captain S'fiso Nyakane said the raid was conducted following an intensive investigation into allegations of fraud and corruption regarding the awarding of a tender in the province. The alleged tender fraud, corruption and possible money laundering involve two companies that were awarded tenders to the value of about R150m during June 2017. Nyakane said the correct procedures were not followed during the awarding process. No arrests were made. "Only documents were seized pertaining to the alleged fraud and corruption," Nyakane said. He said no further information about the raids could be shared and that investigations would continue.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
