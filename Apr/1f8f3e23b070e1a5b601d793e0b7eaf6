Ofhani Magwaba was also given 15 years each for three counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, and three years for housebreaking with intent to commit rape. NPA provincial spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the accused and his accomplice had broken into a church building in October 2013, where they attacked two women who were sleeping. "They attacked the complainants with a panga and knife, before raping them. They also robbed them of their money and mobile phone. The attackers were unknown to the complainants. The accused was connected by DNA evidence to the crimes," said Malabi-Dzhangi. He said in another incident, Magwaba had attacked his victim with an Okapi knife while she was walking from church in Tshilapfene village in October 2009. He raped her and stole her money and cellphone. Magwaba pleaded guilty to all seven counts. In aggravation of sentence, advocate Nnyambeni Nekhambele argued that the accused had previous convictions of robbery and other crimes. He concluded that the accused was a danger to the community and needed to be removed. Nekhambele asked that Magwaba's name be entered onto the National Register for Sex Offenders. Magwaba's sentences will run concurrently. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
