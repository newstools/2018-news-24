The visit comes after allegations made by a group of volunteers that pork had been served to Muslim children at the shelter upon their visit earlier this year (“Muslim kid ‘fed pork’ at Home”, People’s Post, 10 March). “We can confirm that all the meat in stock at Christine Revell Children’s Home is halaal. This includes meat, viennas, sausage, red meat, chicken, dried goods and beef stock, which were all halaal compliant,” says Shaykh Moosa Titus, the chief operations officer of the MJC Halaal Trust. “The director of the home supplied the inspector with a halaal confirmation letter from the Islamic Council of South Africa (ICSA), confirming that all the meats supplied by Cape Halaal Meats are indeed halaal­.” The MJC suspects the person who raised concerns was mistaken or misinformed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
