Baatile John Murambiwa, 39, and Thebeethata Reginald Mandlane, 44, are out on R500 bail after making a brief appearance in the Ventersdorp Magistrate's Court on Wednesday. They were arrested earlier on Wednesday by the Hawks' serious corruption investigation unit. The two, both stationed at the Ventersdorp police station, were investigated after a complaint claiming that they stopped and searched a furniture delivery van on January 9 and found some of the items were ostensibly not listed on the inventory, Hawks spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said in a statement. "The officers then allegedly threatened the driver with arrest and demanded a R550 bribe. The money was subsequently deposited by the owner into one of the suspects' account," Rikhotso said. The case was postponed to April 25. North West provincial Hawks head Major General Linda Mbana warned police officers to "desist from abusing their authority". "Those who prey on innocent people will face the full might of the law," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
