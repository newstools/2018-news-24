were that she be buried at the Fourways Memorial Park, north of Sandton. This
is where Zenani was buried in 2010. Zenani was 13 when she was killed in a car accident in the
early hours of June 11, 2010, after attending the FIFA World Cup kick-off
concert at the Orlando Stadium in Soweto. She was the grandchild of Madikizela-Mandela's oldest
daughter, Zindzi. At the time, the Nelson Mandela Foundation said
Madikizela-Mandela was so devastated upon hearing the news that she was briefly
taken to hospital and treated for shock. Madikizela-Mandela was exceptionally close to Zenani's
mother Zoleka, who earlier shared photos of their last moments together,
attending a Good Friday church service. SEE: Zoleka Mandela's heartrending last pics of grandmother
