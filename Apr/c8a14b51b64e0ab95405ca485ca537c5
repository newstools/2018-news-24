The woman, 74, was walking back to her homestead after visiting her friends in Dadamba on Tuesday afternoon, when she was attacked, said Captain Jackson Manatha. "She came across this young man who did not say anything but attacked her in an unlawful manner. It is believed she was dragged to a bushy area," he said. "She knew this man because he has been a herder of cattle in the same village." A 45-year-old man was traced and arrested after the woman identified him. He was expected to appear in the Willowvale Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Butterworth cluster commander Brigadier Trevor Mey condemned the rape. He congratulated Willowvale police for their swift response in arresting a suspect.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
