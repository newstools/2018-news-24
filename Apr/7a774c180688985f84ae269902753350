the students. "The timetable for the exam was earlier fixed before their weddings were
fixed and interestingly, both were on April 7, 2018. Since the exam couldn’t be
shifted, the two brides left their various reception venues for the examination

saying. "We were happy that our students got married and they (students) were happy
too that they got married and also took their last exams same day. It was a
