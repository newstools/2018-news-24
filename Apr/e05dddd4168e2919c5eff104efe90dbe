Nkosingiphile Gase, 36, Thembinkosi Gcabashe, 39, and Sno Mlamuli Khoza, 38, pleaded guilty to the charges and were each sentenced on Tuesday to one year in prison, suspended for five years. "Police were alerted to the incidents after two separate videos of people discharging firearms in public went viral on social media," acting provincial police commissioner Major Bheki Langa said. "Such people are putting the lives of others at risk as these stray bullets may strike innocent people in the process." Their firearms, suspected to have been used during random shootings in Molweni recently, were also seized and will be subjected to ballistic testing to establish if they were used in the commission of any other crimes. Langa welcomed the sentence. "This sentence sends a clear message that the courts view incidents where people fire gunshots randomly in public places and endanger the lives of innocent people, very seriously. As the SAPS we will do everything within our control to bring the perpetrators of this crime to book," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
