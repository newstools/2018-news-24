Makwande Republic is an experience-based residence where City dwellers visit the village, which is located 60km from Queenstown. Founder Ukhona Mlandu describes it thus: “a gateway from City life. “It is a space where one can take a break, explore a different environment ... Not much goes into planning, rather, the activities are organic, depending on what the group of people feel like doing,” she said. The scenic village and its surrounds has a contested history as it only received its name after the end of the Frontier Wars of the late 1800s. Nestled in the Mathole Mountains, the area has evidence of Khoisan artworks, whose rock art is still evident in the caves and cliffs.
