Rape accused Teboho Nkgooa (34) was sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a minor girl in 2012. He received his sentencing during a recent sitting of the Bloemfontein High Court in Qwaqwa. This verdict ends the six-year wait for justice for the victim, who was nine years old at the time of the incident. Nkgooa raped the minor at night after breaking into the house in the Mbeki Park section of Bluegumbosch where she was sleeping alone one night in February 2012. His conviction and sentencing followed in-depth investigation which included DNA testing. “The case was provisionally withdrawn from the court roll while awaiting DNA results, which came back positive,” said Sgt. Mmako Mophiring, police spokesperson. “Following this, the accused was found guilty of housebreaking with the intent to rape.” Mmako said according to the police findings, the accused had gone to the house shortly after the parents of the victim had left. “He broke into the house and raped the little girl. “Nkgooa fled the scene thereafter, but was seen by a member of the community who gave chase and arrested him. “He was thereafter handed over to the police,” said Mophiring.
