The bus, which was serving a regular route between Sofia and the Black Sea city of Burgas, was hit sideways by a car and flipped over, trapping many passengers inside, president of the Union Ivkoni bus company Georgy Atanasov told public BNR radio. Atanasov said the bus was new and had only been made in 2017. Emergency services spokesperson Katia Sungarska confirmed the toll to AFP, saying that one of those injured was a child.
