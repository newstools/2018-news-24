"[He] did not only occupy the death-defying trenches of the liberation struggle, he was counted among those who held the flag of the country flying high in the process of carving the role of South Africa on the international platforms." Mabe said his contribution to the fight against apartheid would be treasured as the party continues its work "toward the transformation of the world of governance". "The role that [he] played in the liberation of our country cannot be measured." President Cyril Ramaphosa has sent condolences to the Nene family. Nene will be laid to rest on Friday.
