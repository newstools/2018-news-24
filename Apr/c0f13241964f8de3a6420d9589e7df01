"Enhancing the mobility of pensioners and persons with disabilities will improve their access to basic services and economic opportunities," said council speaker Vasco da Gama in a statement about the reasons behind the move. He said the motion was unanimously passed with some amendments at a council sitting last week. These amendments included recommendations that the City organise a budget for the project and that it run a pilot programme in the 2018/2019 financial year. The results and lessons of the pilot would then be discussed ahead of the rollout of a final programme in the 2019/20 financial year. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
