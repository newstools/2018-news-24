IN PICS: A defiant Madikizela-Mandela over the years "I remember Winnie called for the reburial of King Sabata Dalindyebo, and we facilitated that. That was in 1989. When Madiba was released in 1999, she said that he could not be guarded by De Klerk's security. We had to wait for MK to return to SA, so we sent the Transkei defence force to guard him.

That would be when she attacked his governance." Congress of the People leader Mosiuoa Lekota said: "I received with shock and great sadness the news of Winnie Madikizela's passing.
