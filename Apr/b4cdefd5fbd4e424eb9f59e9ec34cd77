Aishah Cassiem @Aishah_Cassiem The mystery of an elderly Hanover Park resident who went missing more than six months ago has finally come to an end (“Local man (68) still missing”, People’s Post, 17 October). Western Cape police have confirmed the dead body found in a canal in Macassar last September is that of 68-year-old Zainodien Moerat. Captain FC van Wyk says an unknown body was found in the canal on Friday 29 September and an inquest case was registered for investigation. The body was removed by a forensic pathologist and taken to the Tygerberg morgue on the day of the discovery, but was only identified by family members last Tuesday. The elderly man was known to roam the streets of Lansdowne, Grassy Park and surrounding areas, and had become a well-known sight to motorists who would recognise him in his green blazer and white fez. Moerat made headlines last year after being accused of conning locals while begging for money at traffic lights. The elderly man, who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, made headlines again soon after when two young men threatened to harm him for lying about his wife’s death in order to gain their kindness. But Moerat’s eldest son told People’s Post shortly after his disappearance that it was unlike their father to stay away for weeks at a time and he urged anyone holding the elderly man hostage to release him. The distraught family and members of the public are now speculating on the elderly man’s death, seeking immediate answers from the police. Meanwhile, Captain Lance Goliath from Philippi Police Station says the police are currently still investigating the cause of the man’s death. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
