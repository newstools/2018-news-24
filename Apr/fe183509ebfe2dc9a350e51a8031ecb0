Pam Golding Properties was established in 1976 when the property industry was dominated by men. She also managed to open an office in London in 1986 – during the Apartheid regime, says Anel Lewis, spokesperson for the property group. There are now 300 offices in Africa, Europe, the Seychelles and Mauritius with roughly 3 000 employees – most of which are real estate agents who considered Pam to be a doyenne in her field. Hers was the property group which was crowned the best in South Africa the most times – at least 10 times since 2005. One of her famous clients was former president Nelson Mandela, who called her one morning at 06:30 and asked her to find him the ideal home in Houghton. “At first I thought it was a practical joker. But he had that unmistakable voice. Well, I got out of bed and put on my gown. I couldn’t possibly chat to the president in my nightie,” she had said. She leaves behind her sons, Peter and Andrew, daughter Jilly, and 10 grandchildren. A few celebs have already paid tribute to Pam: Former Springbok Chester Williams’ wife, Maria.
