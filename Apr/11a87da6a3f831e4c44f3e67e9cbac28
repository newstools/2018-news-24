Sameh Shoukry says in TV comments aired Thursday that all parties "should know that Egypt will not accept the status quo ... and continues to defend the interests of its people regarding the Nile by several means." He did not elaborate. Earlier in April, the foreign ministers of Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia met in Khartoum but talks ended with no deal on the lingering dispute of access to the Nile's waters. Egypt has called for another meeting in Cairo. Egypt is alarmed the so-called Renaissance Dam that Ethiopia is completing will drastically impact its share of the Nile's waters. Ethiopia and Sudan are expected to benefit from the construction. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
