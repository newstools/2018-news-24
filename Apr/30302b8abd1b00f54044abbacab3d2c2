King Mswati III announced it during celebrations of the 50th anniversary of independence and his 50th birthday. It appears to be as easy as that, as the king is an absolute monarch. Many African countries upon independence "reverted to their ancient, native names," he said. "We no longer shall be called Swaziland from today forward." The kingdom will be known by its historic name of eSwatini. The king has used that name in the past at openings of Parliament and other events. Some Swiss have responded with relief as the countries often are confused on online forms. It is not immediately clear how much it will cost the landlocked African country to make the name change. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
