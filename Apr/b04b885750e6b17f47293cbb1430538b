The women marched 1.5km from Uncle Tom's Hall to Madikizela-Mandela's home in Orlando West, Soweto, to lay flowers and light candles in tribute. Dressed in their green, yellow and black party regalia, the women sang and danced to struggle songs as motorbike engines roared. Madikizela-Mandela died at Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Monday afternoon after a long illness, her family said. She was 81 years old. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the party said while saddened by Madikizela-Mandela's death, it was "inspired by her rich legacy in the quest for justice and freedom for the oppressed". "As a member of the ANCWL Gauteng province in good standing she has served both the organisation, the broader liberation movement, and society as whole with distinction. This came at a great personal cost and for that, we remain grateful," the league said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
