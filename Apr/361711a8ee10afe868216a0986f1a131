"For us, it means that we should be ready to go rescue them again. The building might collapse again," Johannesburg Emergency Management Services (EMS) spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi told News24. Mulaudzi said it was disheartening to see people return to the building after their efforts to move them to safer shelters. The three children who died were aged between three and 10. On Monday, Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements Dikgang Uhuru Moiloa said about 100 families had occupied the building illegally. Mulaudzi said alternative accommodation was provided to the residents. "Most of the people don't want emergency shelters. They have a lot of reason to return back to the unsafe building." Mulaudzi said the building remained dangerous and unsafe for people to live in. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
