FECOFA president Constant Omari has been held along with sports ministry secretary general Barthelemy Okito and two FECOFA vice presidents – Roger Bondembe and Theobad Binamungu – since Tuesday evening, the magistrate told AFP. He said the four were "currently being heard" over the use of public funds in the organisation of matches in African competitions involving national sides as well as clubs. Alain Makengo, a lawyer for the four men, told AFP they are suspected of embezzling $1.0m earmarked for four matches. Omari is also vice president of the African Football Confederation and a member of the executive committee of FIFA. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
