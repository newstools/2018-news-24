A UN statement says the three UN staffers and seven aid workers, all of them South Sudanese, went missing on Wednesday when their convoy driving from Yei town to Tore in Central Equatoria disappeared. The aid workers are with South Sudanese Development Organization, ACROSS, Plan International and Action Africa Help. "We are deeply concerned about the whereabouts of these humanitarian workers and are urgently seeking information about their well-being," says the UN humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou. South Sudan is one of the world's most dangerous places for humanitarians. The UN calls this the third such incident in just six months. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
