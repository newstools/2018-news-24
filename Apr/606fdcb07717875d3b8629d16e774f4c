Private TV station En Nahar showed firefighters on Thursday carrying the casket of Rabia Seddiki to the home where he was born 41 years ago in a working-class suburb east of Algiers. Seddiki's father said his son had been a pilot for 15 years, beginning his training at military aviation school, and "he dies a martyr." Bodies from the crash in Boufarik, south of Algiers, were being identified at the capital's military hospital before burial. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
