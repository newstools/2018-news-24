In February 2017, 29-year-old Sfundo Dube offered the student and her friends a lift to their campus after having drinks in Esikhaleni, near Durban. "On their way, the accused took another road to Empangeni. Then the victim [and] her friends, argued with the accused. He then dropped them along the way, but he didn't drop the victim," police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. "The accused took the road to Iniwe, where he parked the vehicle in the bushes and assaulted the victim. The victim tried to escape, but he overpowered her and repeatedly raped her inside the car, a Toyota Hilux." A member of the public noticed Dube's vehicle in the bushes and reported the matter to the police. The accused fled the scene once he spotted the police. A case of rape was transferred to the Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. The accused was arrested the following day. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
