"A memorial service will be held for Judge Leon this Thursday in Durban," one of his staffers said in an e-mail. No further details were given. Ramon Leon was an apartheid-era judge who served on the Natal Bench for over 20 years. He sentenced Andrew Zondo to death for his role in a blast that killed three adults and two children in an Amanzimtoti shopping centre in 1985. The bomb was in response to an SA Defence Force raid on Maseru, Lesotho, a few days earlier in which nine people were killed. Zondo was hanged less than nine months after the bombing. Leon Senior served in other roles, including chairing a Lesotho commission of enquiry into the causes of political violence in 1998. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
