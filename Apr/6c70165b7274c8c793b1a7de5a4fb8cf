ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics responded to the scene and arrived shortly after 15:00. He said when paramedics arrived on scene, they had found a large tipper truck parked beneath some powerlines and the body of a man was found lying next to the vehicle. "Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained serious burn wounds and showed no signs of life. "Unfortunately, nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead," he said. Meiring said it was believed that the loading bay of the truck had made contact with the above powerlines, causing the man to be electrocuted when he apparently touched the vehicles control unit. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
