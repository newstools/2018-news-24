The competition is being held in the Tunisian seaside resort of Hammamet from April 6-13. A judicial official said the court rendered its decision earlier this week after the Tunisian group known as the National Commission for Supporting Arab Resistance and Opposing Normalisation and Zionism sued the president of the Tunisian taekwondo federation, Ahmed Gaaloul. Prosecutor's spokesperson Sofiane Selliti told The Associated Press that the court decision stipulates that Gaaboul can't invite, or host, the four Israeli athletes whose names were on the list of contestants. Gaaloul said they will not be invited because they did not complete the paperwork to enter the tournament There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli taekwondo federation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
