My bigger mission is beyond the confines of politics and political parties," she wrote.Khosa said that a potential opportunity had arisen.'Elevation of black African languages'"I have always wanted to put my post graduate qualifications, especially my doctoral degree in Quality Management Principles and Systems (QMPS) in developmental local governance and extensive experience in local government, into use and in a manner that would deliver maximum positive impact to local citizens."She highlighted the plight of the South African education system as a passion, pointing to her research in an isiZulu language mathematical logic series and a dictionary called UZALO.She said she would be working with her son, Mlando, a computer programmer and computer science student, who had developed an algorithm that is consistent with aBantu languages."My son and I have decided to join forces in the elevation of black African languages in South Africa," she wrote, saying it was the first time since her husband's death that she would be able to spend weekends with her children."It is within this context that I have taken a decision to step down from politics," she wrote."I also hope that ADeC would continue with its Politics Unusual concept, its commitment to the total emancipation of women, loyalty to the South African citizens and ensuring that at all times it is grounded in moral and ethical leadership."As the leading founder of ADeC and its director of its Non-Profit Organization (NPO), I therefore resign from both structures and authorize the ADeC National Board under the chairmanship of Moses Mayekiso to liaise with the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and the other directors of the non-profit organisations to fill the vacant position as a result of my resignation and stepping down from politics."READ the full letter below:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
