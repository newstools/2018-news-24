Monday's court appearance comes as angry protests over the case have spread across the country. The child's battered body was found in a forest in January, a week after she went missing while grazing her family's ponies. Police say the accused men, all Hindus, planned the child's kidnapping for over a month as part of a plan to scare her Muslim nomadic tribe away from the area. Police said the child was sedated and held captive at a Hindu temple where she was repeatedly raped before being strangled and bludgeoned to death.
