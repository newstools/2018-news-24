His brother Brandon, 17, and stepsister Shannon Troskie, 13, were killed in a car crash in Mpumalanga on Monday. The accident occurred on the P185 road between Evander and Secunda. Norman says he and his brother shared a close bond. They regularly went fishing and hunting and spent holidays together. “I came close to losing it. I just burst into tears,” Norman told YOU on Thursday afternoon. He says he last communicated with Brandon on Whatsapp just days before the accident. “I asked him how he was doing and what he was up to. He said it was school holidays.” The bakkie in which Brandon, Shannon, Shannon’s mom, Michelle, and Shannon’s youngest brother, Triston, 9, were travelling in collided with the back of a truck. “At the scene the paramedics found a woman and a girl trapped in the bakkie. A young man aged about 17 was found metres away from the bakkie while a younger boy was walking around at the scene,” ER24’s Russel Meiring said in a statement. Brandon and Shannon were confirmed dead on the scene. Shannon’s mom and brother were admitted to separate hospitals for further treatment. Michelle is still under sedation and Triston is expected to be discharged this week. Norman says his stepsister was a relaxed, jokey child. “We’re all terribly sad about their passing and I’ll miss my brother. He’ll be in my thoughts until we meet again one day,” he said. Their funerals are expected to be held in Secunda next week.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
