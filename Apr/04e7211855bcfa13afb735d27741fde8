Police spokesperson Edet Okon says the extremists attacked the Jidari Polo area on Thursday near the Federal High Court. He says security forces repelled many of the attackers in a gun battle after they marched through the neighbourhood. He says two female suicide attackers also were killed. Civilian defence forces head Muhammed Babagoni says one detonated her explosives after knocking on the door of a house. Maiduguri is the birthplace of Boko Haram's nearly decade-long insurgency and is often targeted. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
