They join NMU chair of council, former ambassador Nozipho January-Bardill. "I am honoured to form part of this trio of women," said Fraser-Moleketi at the ceremony. She said NMU was the only university to have three women at its helm, according to the NMU Facebook page. Fraser-Moleketi added that she was "deeply humbled" by the confidence the council and university community had in her. Her acceptance speech paid tribute to many prominent leaders, including the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and ANC veteran Zola Skweyiya, who she said were her former colleagues. The university announced Fraser-Moleketi, a former minister for public service and administration, as its new chancellor last month, effective from April 1. She was awarded an honorary doctorate at the institution last year for her contribution to leadership in social and economic transformation, with specific emphasis on the empowerment of women.
