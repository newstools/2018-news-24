LIVE: Visitors arrive at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's home to pay respects Ndamase added that she had not only raised her two daughters, Zindziswa and Zenani Mandela, but she had also raised many destitute children who were subjected to abject poverty by the apartheid system. "Our nation will remember this social worker for many charity programmes she assisted with in various villages and townships of our country. We will always miss this icon of the struggle - the voice of the voiceless, that remained a watchdog to the ruling party until the end," he said. Madikizela-Mandela died on Monday at the age of 81.
