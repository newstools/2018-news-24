has taken over a farm run by a state agricultural agency, a newspaper claimed
on Friday. The Zimbabwe Independent reports that the 300-hectare seed
farm run by the Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (ARDA) is being
guarded by men with automatic weapons and that workers are erecting a new fence
around the property. "ARDA Seeds is no longer here; this is now the vice
president's property," one of the armed men was quoted as telling the paper. Former president Robert Mugabe’s controversial land reform
programme, which was launched in 2000, sparked a long-running economic and
political crisis. This takeover, if confirmed, will bring back memories of
that, though this is not a white-owned farm. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook The farm is on the north-eastern outskirts of Harare. It is
understood to have produced seed for crops like potatoes, sunflowers, wheat and
sorghum. The vice president’s wife Mary made no comment on the
alleged takeover, referring the paper to the agriculture ministry. In December Agriculture Minister Perrance Shiri, the former
air force chief who was promoted into cabinet after Mugabe’s ouster last year,
ordered an end to farm takeovers in the country, according to the state-run Chronicle newspaper. "We need total stability on the farms and to that effect we
shall ensure that farm occupations will not be tolerated anymore," he said
then. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
