It a statement on Friday, the Portfolio Committee on Sport said it was ‘appalled’ by the rules, which would have a direct bearing on Semenya.

Although the IAAF had to ensure the administration of athletics, Dlulane said "if in hosting competitions the international body interferes with human rights of athletes, then the sporting community has a right to point that out and be angry". Dlulane called on the the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, under the guidance of government, to challenge the IAAF's decision. The new regulations, which will come into effect from November 1, 2018, apply to women who race in five track events - 400m, 800m, 1500m, one mile and 400m hurdles. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
