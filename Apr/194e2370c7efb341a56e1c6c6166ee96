"It's a multiparty event with speakers from the DA, Azapo and other organisations," she told News24. "I'm here as a friend of Mama Winnie." Her spokesperson Xolani Koyana said the request had come from Madikizela-Mandela's family. The embattled DA member took her seat among delegates on the stage at Majwemasweu Stadium in Brandfort after a welcoming hug from EFF leader Julius Malema. De Lille was named as a "special colleague" in the EFF's event programme and is 19th on the list of speakers.

This was postponed indefinitely last month after one of the chairpersons recused himself. De Lille believes the party is trying to "get rid" of her. Last week she laid flowers in the foyer of St George's Cathedral, where a collage of photos of the liberation struggle leader was displayed, and described Madikizela-Mandela as a "real symbol of resistance".
