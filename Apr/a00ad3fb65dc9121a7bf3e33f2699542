The children were aged between three and 10. According to Moiloa, about 100 families occupied the building illegally at the time. "It was established that the building was illegally occupied and not suitable for human habitation." READ: Three children die after wall collapses in abandoned Joburg building Moiloa said all occupants were removed from the building and added that the rest of the "dangerous structure" was demolished to prevent a further collapse. "It is not only sad and tragic, that yet another set of children had to die under such horrific circumstances as a clear reminder of the social ills of illegal occupation." Arrangements were under way to secure alternative accommodation for the families who lived there. "The entire building remains in an unstable condition and poses several safety risks due to the heavy rains, the illegal water and electrical connections, and the overall structural state of the building." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
