"A lot of people have identified him. He was screaming his head off and clearly at the location where the four fires started so people suspected it may be him," said safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith. The man was found with petrol and other fire-making devices, he said. Western Cape police spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut, confirmed that Cape Town police arrested a man in his forties on a charge of arson. Traut said they were investigating the circumstances around the fire. The fires were above the lower Cableway station. Firefighters were dispatched to Tafelberg Road just after noon. Two fire engines and a water tanker were on the ground, while two helicopters were assisting from above.         24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
