According to the South African Council of Educators, nearly 600 cases of abuse by teachers have been reported. DA shadow minister of basic education, Ian Ollis, and his deputy Nomsa Marchesi held a meeting last week to discuss school safety and the vetting of teachers. The DA has drafted a letter to the minister responsible for schools‚ Angie Motshekga‚ calling on her to ensure that there were proper checks in place. This process includes the submission of a clearance certificate from the police and the department of justice in relation to the sexual offences register before a teacher is registered. “Teacher misconduct at schools is detrimental to the safety of pupils. “In the last financial year alone‚ 593 cases were reported to the council which is a staggering number. These cases included 99 allegations of sexual misconduct or rape, and 265 of physical assault or corporal punishment,” said Ollis. Basic education committee chairwoman Nomalungelo Gina said: “We will keep a close eye on the process.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
