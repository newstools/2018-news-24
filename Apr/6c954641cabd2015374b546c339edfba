Police chief Franco Gabrielli said 21-year-old Alagie Touray wasn't caught plotting a specific attack. But he said Italy's intelligence agencies suspected it was "highly probable" that he might, given the pledge he purportedly made in a video and sent by the Telegram app. He had received instructions to drive a car into a crowd, the ANSA news agency reported.

Naples chief prosecutor Giovanni Melillo said Touray was accused of participation in a terrorist association. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
