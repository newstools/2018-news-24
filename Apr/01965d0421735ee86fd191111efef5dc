The group, however, remains tight-lipped about who it intends to prosecute, only saying that it was a well-known leader of a political party. The announcement is set to be made in Centurion on Thursday morning by AfriForum's private prosecution head, the so-called "pit bull" himself, advocate Gerrie Nel.

The group's legal team previously threatened legal action against the Economic Freedom Fighters and its leader, Julius Malema, after he allegedly made racist remarks at a political gathering in March. Malema allegedly said white people should be glad that the EFF did not call for a genocide. This will be AfriForum's second private prosecution after it announced in October 2017, that it would legally pursue Duduzane Zuma, the son of former president Jacob Zuma.

Although an inquest found that Duduzane's negligence led to the crash, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) decided in August 2015 not to prosecute.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
