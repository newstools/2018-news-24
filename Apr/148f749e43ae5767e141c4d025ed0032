SITE Intelligence Group reported on Friday that the al-Qaeda branch in Mali posted a message saying it had carried out the attack nearly a week ago. The message called it retaliation for a series of recent military operations that had killed some of the branch's fighters. Witnesses said the attackers struck the town of Timbuktu in vehicles disguised as belonging to the Malian military and the UN peacekeeping mission. Extremists controlled Timbuktu and other northern towns in 2012 before a French-led military operation forced them from power the following year. They have continued to attack Malian and international forces. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
