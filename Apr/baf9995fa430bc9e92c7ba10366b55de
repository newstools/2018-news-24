Mabuza, who is also the ruling party's deputy president, was among the high profile leaders who visited fallen struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's family home on Wednesday in Orlando West, Soweto. Like many others, Mabuza spoke fondly of Madikizela-Mandela's role in the struggle. He said that funeral arrangements were going ahead smoothly. READ: 'Winnie rose above her mistakes', says teary Rivonia trialist Denis Goldberg ANC parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu, who also visited the family home, said the ANC parliamentary caucus would attend the funeral. "We will be there in our hundreds. More than that, after her burial, we have an ANC memorial service in Parliament and we will also have a debate honouring Mam' Winnie in Parliament as well. A debate where all parties will participate." Shortly after news of her death made headlines, President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the family home. After spending some time with the bereaved family, he confirmed to journalists and photographers camped outside the house that Madikizela-Mandela would receive a special official funeral on April 14. Government has also reserved 10 days of mourning, with national flags to be flown at half-mast. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
