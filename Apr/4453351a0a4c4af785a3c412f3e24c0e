on a working visit, reports say. According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, Masisi was expected to hold
talks with his Zimbabwean counterpart President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Masisi took over from former president Ian Khama on April 1. In a statement, Botswana's ministry of international affairs and co-operation
said the visit would give the two leaders a platform to discuss regional,
continental and global issues of mutual concern. Mnangagwa was in Botswana for his first official state visit last month after
taking over from former president Robert Mugabe last November as the two
nations sought to build bridges following strained relations between Mugabe and
Khama. A Sunday Mail report said that Masisi was also expected to visit Namibia to meet President Hage Geingob. This, the report said, was part of a long-standing tradition in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region where new heads of state payed courtesy calls on their neighbours. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
