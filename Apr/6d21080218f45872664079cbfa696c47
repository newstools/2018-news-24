Ing-wen's first trip to the nation of 1.3 million people marks 50 years of official ties between the two countries, the king's 50th birthday and a half-century of Swaziland's independence. Ing-wen won election as Taiwan's first female president in 2016. She has refused to endorse China's insistence that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and ties with Beijing have plummeted.

Taiwan's other remaining ally in Africa is Burkina Faso. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
