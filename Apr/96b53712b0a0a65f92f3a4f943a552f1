Opposition politicians and the local bar association are challenging the law, passed in December, that allows President Yoweri Museveni to potentially hold power for nearly five decades. The law removed a measure in the constitution that prevented anyone older than 75 from being president. Museveni, a US ally who took power by force in 1986, is 73 and would have been ineligible to run again when his term expires in 2021. Museveni is the latest of a number of African leaders who have tried to prolong their time in power by changing the constitution or other means. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
