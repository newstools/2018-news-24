She decided to become a reporter to prove that a powerful politician had ordered a hit on Luis Lopez Peralta, more than 20 years ago. Now Diana, 31, has seen Juan Francisco Gómez – aka Kiko – jailed for murder in the Colombian capital of Bogotá. Diana’s father was murdered on 22 February 1997, when he was a councillor in the town of Barrancas, in the Colombian Department of La Guajira. He decided to run for mayor against Kiko, whom he accused of running a corrupt administration. Luis was gunned down by hired assassins and later that year Kiko was recognised by the Colombian congress as "the best mayor of the state". It’s unclear if the hired hands were ever apprehended. Diana was always convinced Kiko was responsible and decided to become a journalist to prove it. After finishing her journalism studies at university, Diana moved to Bogotá and got in touch with many journalists interested in the case. One of them was Gonzalo Guillén, who was already investigating Kiko, and had found 131 deaths linked to him. A case was eventually opened against Kiko who was convicted of three murders and sentenced to 55 years in prison. One of the murders he was convicted of was that of Diana’s father. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
