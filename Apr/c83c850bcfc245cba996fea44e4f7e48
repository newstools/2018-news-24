"All possible precautions are being taken to limit the spread of the virus by people and their activities. As these are wild birds, containing the natural spread of the virus is not possible," she said. Avian influenza is spread from bird to bird via mucus and faeces. There are no indications that the virus will affect humans, but a small risk of infection remains.
