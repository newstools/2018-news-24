Watch.WATCH City of Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina has agreed to sign a settlement agreement in Brakpan, Johannesburg on Friday, bringing to a close a South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) mediation process. The process was initiated after four complainants approached the SAHRC, alleging that comments Masina had made on April 10, 201, at an event held to commemorate the late Chris Hani, amounted to hate speech. "It is very important that we send a very strong warning that we will crush any individual who stands in the way of the project of nation building and social cohesion in South Africa," was one of the statements Masina made. "It might be very rough and we are many, this is not a threat, we are many, it might be very rough. I want to say to our white counterparts in South Africa, they must be very careful." The SAHRC determined that the matter would be resolved best through mediation and invitations were sent to the complainants and Masina, Gauteng SAHRC manager Buang Jones said. "The respondent advised the commission that he was willing to subject himself to the mediation process, facilitated by the commission," Jones added. Only one of the three complainants availed himself for the mediation. During the process, both parties were given a platform to recount their version of the events and upon the conclusion of the discussion, various terms of settlement were reached. These resulted in a settlement agreement which is expected to be signed by the parties. The terms are unknown at this stage. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
