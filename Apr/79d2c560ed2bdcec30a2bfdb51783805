Adel Sabry was arrested on Tuesday and his website, Masr al-Arabiya which has been blocked in Egypt since May 2017, was shut down. The prosecutor remanded him into custody on allegations he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and used the website to promote the group's ideology. The Brotherhood, for decades Egypt's main opposition movement, was blacklisted as a "terrorist group" in December 2013 after the military ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi. Sabry is the editor-in-chief of Masr al-Arabiya, which describes itself as an independent media outlet founded in 2012. Masr al-Arabiya is among about 500 websites which have been blocked by Egyptian authorities. Egypt ranks 161 out of 180 countries in terms of press freedoms, according to watchdog Reporters Without Borders' 2017 Press Freedoms Index. At least 29 journalists are in detention, according to Reporters Without Borders, including some accused of working for media affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.
