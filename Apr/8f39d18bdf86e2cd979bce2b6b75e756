The Boeing 777, with the registration code Z-RGM, made a low fly past over Harare’s main Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport before it touched down early afternoon from Malaysia. Pictures from the runway showed Bona Mugabe with her husband, Simba Chikore, who was aboard the plane and dressed in a pilot’s uniform. It was unclear if Chikore, a trained airline pilot, had been at the controls. See pictures below Chikore was chief operating officer at the debt-ridden Air Zimbabwe at the time a deal was reportedly sealed last year with Malaysia Airlines to purchase pre-used planes.

He said the government – now headed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa - plans to acquire six more smaller aircraft. Debt-ridden Air Zimbabwe is currently banned from flying to Europe because of safety concerns. Last year there was speculation the government of former president Robert Mugabe would try to create a new airline called Zimbabwe Airways so that it can resume flights on lucrative European routes. Mugabe was forced to step down during a military takeover in November. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
