Media reports said Mohammed's private plane landed on Monday night in Casablanca, the economic capital of Morocco, and he was expected on Tuesday in the northern city of Fez for official functions. The 54-year-old king has not been in Morocco at least since the 26th of February when he underwent the operation to normalise his heartbeat. Mohammed, who has ruled since his father Hassan's death in July 1999, would resume his normal activities after a period of rest prescribed by his doctors, according to an official statement issued at the time. The king's lengthy absence stirred rumours on social media and also raised questions in diplomatic and business circles. A frequent visitor to France, Mohammed's first official function since the operation was a meeting on the 10th of April with French President Emmanuel Macron. He did not, however, attend the Arab summit held on Sunday in the Saudi city of Dhahran. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
