The company he worked for was looking for him on Tuesday morning and checked the tracker of the company vehicle to find his location, said Captain Siphokazi Mawisa. "It was discovered that the vehicle was standing still." Around 07:15, a colleague went to his home at Summerpride 1, Nkqonkqweni, outside King Williams Town, and found the man was dead and had wounds on the upper half of his body. "The circumstances surrounding the murder are still unclear and are under investigation," said Mawisa. Daily Dispatch named the man as cattle farmer and ISG international construction manager Des Krause. The police are urging anyone with information about the murder to contact Lieutenant Colonel Phindile Kananda on 082 551 6907 or 043 605 6011, SAPS Crime Stop on 08600 10111 or SMS Crime Line on 32211. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
