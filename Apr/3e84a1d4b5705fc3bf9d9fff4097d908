Eleven were sentenced to three years in prison and two were sentenced to five on charges of illegal assembly, inciting against the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of law enforcement, and belonging to an outlawed group. The Cairo Criminal Court's verdict on Saturday was reported by the state-run Al-Ahram website. The verdict can be appealed.
