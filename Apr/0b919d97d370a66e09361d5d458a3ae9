The men, Charles Ranyao, 41, and Stelio Rosario Mkize, 33, disappeared after they were released on bail. They also face charges of attempted murder, and are wanted for the alleged possession of prohibited firearms, ammunition and jamming devices. The Hawks are offering a reward of up to R100 000 for any information that may lead to their arrest and prosecution. "The wanted accused are dangerous and habitual criminals who are likely to continue committing violent crimes for as long as they are on the loose," Hawks spokesperson Captain Lloyd Ramovha said. The two men, and a third man, identified as Clement Edward Manzini, 34, were initially denied bail in the Alexandra Magistrate's Court. However, on appeal, the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg released them on bail of R25 000 each, Ramovha said. Neither of them showed up for subsequent courts appearances, Ramovha added.
