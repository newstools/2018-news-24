Police in KwaZulu-Natal said on Wednesday that he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The woman was walking back from a local tuckshop in Birdswood, Richards Bay in March last year when she was approached by Nkululeko Mdakane, who allegedly demanded money and her cellphone at knifepoint. "The victim told him that she did not have it and he stabbed her and threatened to kill her before raping her," said police spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane. "After the incident the victim managed to run away and fortunately she came across a man who helped her and took her to the police station." A case of rape was opened and transferred to the Empangeni Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for further investigation. Mdakane was apprehended after an "intensive investigation" was conducted. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for rape and five years for attempted murder. The sentences will not run concurrently. The KwaZulu-Natal Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Bheki Langa, commended detectives for their excellent investigation. "We don't have any space for rapists in our communities and we will make sure that those who are terrorising our women and children are brought to book. Women and children must break the silence and report any abuse to their nearest police stations," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
