Mapfumo has not set his foot in the southern African country since 2004, when he settled in the United States. Jailed by the country's former white rulers over his protest music, he later was hounded by the black government that succeeded them. "I don't want to be involved in politics I am just here for the people. I am here for everyone. I just belong to the poor people, that’s where I come from," BBC quoted Mapfumo as saying. Mapfumo announced in a video message in January that he would perform in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, on April 28, according to Associated Press. His spokesperson Blessing Vava confirmed the gig at the time and said that the new government had assured the 72-year-old musician of his safety. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
