The Director of Defence Corporate Communication, Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi, said the deployment followed debilitating labour action by workers within the health sector in the province. He said the SAMHS was mobilising to be in position at the North West Provincial Hospital by Saturday at the earliest, in order to alleviate the plight of the affected citizens of the province who were currently bearing the brunt of the labour action. "The health care practitioners from the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) will be moving into the province to ensure that affected citizens at the Provincial Hospital are provided with the critical health care service they need." "This is done with the understanding that lives need to be preserved at all costs," Mgobozi said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
