The routine happened before a third division match Sunday in the city of Pyatigorsk. TV footage from the game showed the animal being led to the Mashuk-KMV Pyatigorsk club's stadium, clapping at spectators. The bear, named Tima, also held the ball before handing it over to the referee. The stadium's announcer claimed that the bear would take part in the World Cup's opening ceremony in Moscow in June, but soccer authorities haven't confirmed that. The club's manager said it was borrowed from a circus. The New York-based World Animal Protection group condemned the stunt, saying that it's clear from the footage that "cruel training methods have been used" on the bear. Rustam Dudov, manager of the Mashuk club which arranged for the bear to perform, told the Sport Express newspaper on Monday that the bear was borrowed from a traveling circus which approached the club suggesting that the bear perform before the game. Dudov said the Russian Football Union approved the performance.
