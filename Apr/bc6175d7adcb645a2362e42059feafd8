ROUND-UP: Protest action across South Africa The protests then moved to the town of Warrenton, about 30km away from Jan Kempdorp, where an attempt was made to block the N12 highway.  "Police were there and managed to keep the road open again," said Kock. He said there were clashes between protesters and police and that the group had eventually moved to a nearby township on Tuesday evening. This protest appeared not to be related to the nationwide strike organised by the South African Federation of Trade Unions.
