The downpour had caused flash floods on the streets, leaving parts of the capital, Cairo, and other parts of Egypt impassable. Footage on social media showed floods, leaky ceilings and parked cars completely submerged in water. On Thursday, al-Sisi sought to reassure people that measures would be taken to prevent this from recurring. He said on his Twitter account: "I understand completely the suffering of some Egyptians due to the sudden and unusual rainfall." Al-Sisi added that he confirms the state and Egyptian authorities will "intensify their efforts to prevent such incidents from recurring." Egypt's Meteorological Authority Ahmed Abdel-Al says the weather is expected to improve by Friday. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
