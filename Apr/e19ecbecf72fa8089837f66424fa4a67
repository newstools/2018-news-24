Daniel Dzambukeri was found guilty of murdering Hlayisani Precious Hlongwane, 26, last year after he promised to drive her to Hlomela village in Giyani, but instead drove the car into nearby bushes. "The deceased's legs were then tied against a tree [and] then she was left alone. In the evening, the accused returned to the spot, attacked the deceased, broke her arm and cut off her body parts before killing her," said Lieutenant Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. A police investigation led to the arrest of Dzambukeri and three other suspects who were later released on bail. Nkhensani Christinah Mhlongo, 52, Solomon Mgengeni Mahumani, 53, and Amos Mafemani Chuma, 45, are expected to hear their fate when they appear in court on May 2. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba welcomed the long jail term and commended the Giyani detectives on a job well done. "We hope that removing this criminal from our streets for such a long time will serve as a deterrent to all criminals out there and our communities will also [live] peacefully," said Ledwaba. "All the criminals who are still engaged in any form of criminal activities, especially against women, will be dealt with mercilessly and without compromise," he added.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
