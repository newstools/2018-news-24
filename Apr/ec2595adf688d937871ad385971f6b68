The park's general manager, Bill Taylor, said that the land had been earmarked for development. "The park was meant to close down long ago for developmental purposes. It’s amazing that we have been able to keep the park operational for so long," he said. "The exciting news is that we will be opening a new family entertainment centre before the end of the year." The new development will keep the Ratanga Junction branding. Taylor said that he could identify with the sentimental value the park held for its visitors. "Ratanga Junction has been a place of fun, and families have created memories here over 19 years. "Personally, the closure is bittersweet, but the smaller rides will be available in the new facilities." Taylor added that two of the big roller coasters had already been sold and would be sent overseas. "We are still looking for a home for The Slingshot and the Congo Queen somewhere in the Western Cape, so that Capetonians can still enjoy them," he said. Ratanga Junction is offering a special on all tickets. "All tickets are sold at R95 and will be available online on Webtickets and at the gate," said Taylor. "We look forward to giving Capetonians one last ride."
