Madikizela-Mandela died at the age of 81 on Monday and is considered the "Mother of the Nation" for her role in the anti-apartheid movement. "This shocking news came just a month away from the WSU graduation where she was to be conferred an honorary degree in social science," said university spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo. "The university profoundly expresses deepest sadness and sends condolences to the Madikizela-Mandela families for the loss of this struggle icon," she said. Tukwayo said that the university was considering conferring the degree posthumously later in the year once the university had engaged her family. "Her activism and resistance to apartheid qualified her as the mother of the nation even after Nelson Mandela decided to leave the presidential seat," said Tukwayo. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
