MMC for health and social development in Johannesburg, Dr Mpho Phalatse, said the woman allegedly collapsed outside of the clinic after she was apparently told to return home and prepare to go to hospital. The incident happened on April 6. Phalatse said the woman was rushed back to the same clinic where she gave birth to twin boys. According to Phalatse, the mother and the babies were in good health, following her visit this week Wednesday. She said the nurses failed to adhere to the principles of the Hippocratic Oath, "to do good (beneficence) and do no harm (non-maleficence)". "I am extremely disappointed at the seemingly lackadaisical approach to attending to this patient, and even more so at the attempt to hide the truth, misleading both myself and management." Disciplinary action will be instituted once the investigation into the matter had been concluded. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
