Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo told News24 the child died in the blaze on Friday night. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said paramedics responded to the scene in Third Road where a fire had broken out in a flat. "Several people had already evacuated and were crowded on the pavement. Paramedics began to assess the patients and found that seven were suffering mild smoke inhalation," he said. They were treated but later declined transportation to a hospital. "Once the fire services had extinguished the blaze, the body of an 8-year-old boy was found. Unfortunately, the boy had already succumbed to his injuries. Nothing could be done for him and he was declared dead." Masondo confirmed an inquest docket has been opened.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
