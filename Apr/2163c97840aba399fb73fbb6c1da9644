CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 Lazer 911 security guard Gansen Naidoo said he was on his way to a call in Port Shepstone when he passed the taxi near the petrol station. He said the taxi swerved onto his lane before veering off the road and stopping. Someone got out of the driver’s seat and moments later he heard two shots fired and decided to turn around and see what was going on. He then called Lemon for back up. “When I arrived on the scene we were told that a man in a blue jacket had fired the shots and fled the scene. I went to search the area and found a man fitting the description hiding behind the petrol station and speaking on the phone. I phoned Gensen and told him I had found him,” said Lemon. He said he then approached the man and grabbed his arm, but the man pulled out a gun. The two then wrestled for the gun and during the altercation Lemon said he heard two shots fired. “I had him on the ground because I saw two cars in the area with two families with children inside, and I thought to at least try to safeguard them if anything happened. He fired a third shot and I saw him pointing the gun at my face, however, in that moment my colleague Gansen shot at him,” said Lemon. Lemon (27) said that although he is a trained guard and an adrenalin junkie in such instances, the near-death experience had him evaluate his life. “In that moment, as the gun was facing me, I said a short prayer. When I heard that final shot, I closed my eyes and thought it was over. I thought I was dying. I’d really like to thank my colleague Gansen Naidoo for saving my life,” said Lemon.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
