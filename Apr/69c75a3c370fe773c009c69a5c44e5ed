Two fire engines and a water tanker were on the ground, while two helicopters assisted from above just after noon. "Our crew remains on the scene, checking for hotspots. It is just a matter of monitoring the area now," said City of Cape Town fire and rescue services spokesperson Theo Layne. Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut confirmed that a man in his forties was arrested for allegedly starting the fires. He was found with petrol and other fire-making devices, said safety and security mayoral committee member JP Smith. "A lot of people have identified him. He was screaming his head off and clearly at the location where the four fires started so people suspected it may be him," said Smith. Traut said that the circumstances around the fire are under investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
