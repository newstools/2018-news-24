German news agency dpa cites Help organisation's deputy manager Bianca Kaltschmitt as saying a colleague in Niger was kidnapped on Wednesday. An organisation staffer in Niger's capital, Niamey, says the attackers came on motorcycles and seized the worker, burning the vehicle in which he was traveling. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the press. The staffer says the aid worker and his Nigerien colleagues did not have a military escort. Several extremist groups are active in the region where four US soldiers and five Nigerien ones were killed in October. * Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox:  SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER FOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
