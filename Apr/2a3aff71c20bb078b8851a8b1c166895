The law passed late on Sunday would ban the cultivation of rice, bananas and other crops, with violators facing prison time and a fine of up to $3 000. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi would need to approve the law. The Nile provides virtually all the freshwater for Egypt's 100 million people. Al-Sisi says the country is building desalination plants on the Red Sea to reduce its dependence on the river as Ethiopia nears completion of the dam.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
