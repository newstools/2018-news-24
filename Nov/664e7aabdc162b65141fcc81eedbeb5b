"Kill the boer", "Viva Juju" and "Viva EFF" were reportedly painted in big red letters. News24 earlier reported that a 50-year-old man and his 45-year-old wife were attacked in their Western Cape house on Sunday night. Police are investigating cases of attempted murder and sexual assault. "According to information, three unknown men entered the victims' home and assaulted both of them (husband and wife)," Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said in a statement on Monday.
