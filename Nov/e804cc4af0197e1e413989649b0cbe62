The police response team, supported by a chopper, followed the vehicle and a shootout between the suspects and the police ensued until Klipspruit West. "Two suspects were arrested after jumping out of the vehicle and two others while inside the getaway vehicle. One of the arrested suspects died at the scene. It was later established that the vehicle was stolen over the weekend in Johannesburg.
