About 30 shacks burned down and about 130 people, including children, were left homeless. The fire is the second in Khayelitsha in about a month. About 1 300 people were left homeless in SST when an inferno destroyed about 300 shacks last month. The City of Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of Tuesday’s fire was unknown. Fire victim Fikiswa Mooi (29) said she only managed to escape with her hand bag and some important documents. “I was at a nearby spaza shop when I saw the smoke. Initially, I thought there is someone burning rubbish. It was when I heard someone screaming ‘fire, fire’ that I realised it was something more serious. And the flames were already big,” she said. Mooi, who is staying with her bigger sister said all other belongings burned in the fire. “All the stuff including bed, fridge, cupboard and some clothes caught fire because I was unable to take them out. “I don’t know what to do and I am concerned what is my sister going to say because all her stuff burned up,” said the mother of two children. Ward councillor Xolisa Peter said she informed the City about the incident and promised to bring building material for the fire victims to rebuild their shacks. “For now those who don’t have place to stay we keep them at the Resource Centre, opposite Lingelethu West Police Station till they rebuild their shacks,” she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
