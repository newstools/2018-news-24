According to a GoFundMe page set up by the 33-year-old’s friends on 9 November, while Ed and Nicola were walking home, a car mounted the pavement and smashed him against the wall, crushing his pelvis. Ed was pronounced clinically dead in the ambulance but later resuscitated by paramedics. His leg was amputated after an 11-hour operation and he’s spent two weeks in intensive care at Southmead Hospital, Bristol Live reports. “I remember the car hitting me, but I don’t really remember anything too much after that,” he said. He faces a long road to recovery and will have to spend several months in hospital, unable to work. The online funding page, titled “Bionic Ed”, was created to ease financial strain as he recuperates, with £7 850 (more than R1,49 million) already having being raised. “We know it’s coming up to that time of year where finances are tight, so any donations you can make, big or small, will mean so much,” it read. “It will make a world of difference by taking away any added stresses when they [Ed and Nicola] leave the hospital,” it continued. Ed said he was grateful for the overwhelming support he’s received, Mirror reports. “I’ve had so many messages from people which really touched me. I would just like to thank everyone who’s donated or got in touch to wish me well,” he added. Sources: Mirror, GoFundMe, Bristol Live 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
