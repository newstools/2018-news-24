Kaveel Singh South African Twitter users have expressed their opinion on the resignation of embattled former minister of home affairs Malusi Gigaba. Gigaba, who has been closely associated with the infamous Gupta family and state capture, went viral with the hashtag #MalusiGigaba on Tuesday shortly after officially resigning. Gigaba left office amid mounting political pressure after the Constitutional Court maintained a High Court ruling that found that he had lied under oath and violated the Constitution and the surfacing of a leaked video of him engaged in a sexual act. One user, Sphelele (‏@SpheDludla), noted that Gigaba appeared to have deleted his Twitter account shortly after the announcement. #MalusiGigaba has deleted his Twitter account.
