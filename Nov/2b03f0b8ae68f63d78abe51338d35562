This follows a joint operation by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID)  and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD). The suspect is stationed at Douglasdale police station. IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini says a complainant had gone to the JMPD offices to report an alleged extortion incident in which police officers from Douglasdale police station allegedly demanded R3 000 from the complainant in return for not impounding his taxi and not arresting his driver for allegedly parking the vehicle illegally. "An entrapment operation was arranged in line with the relevant prescripts [and] a constable was arrested for corruption and possession of unlicensed ammunition," Dlamini said. Dlamini says an accomplice, who is a sergeant also based at Douglasdale police station, managed to escape. "A docket of escaping from custody has been registered." The constable is expected to appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court on Thursday on a charge of corruption, while a search is underway for the sergeant.
