WATCH Fires along the Garden Route had not flared up by Sunday afternoon as firefighters in the Southern Cape continued mopping up, according to a statement. In Diepwalle, two spots were smoldering in an indigenous forest but were contained, the Garden Route District Municipality's joint operations centre (JOC) said. Fire lines were well-contained in Waboomskraal. Cape Nature was patrolling the area and would monitor throughout the evening. In Spitskop/Dubbelberg, there was a smoldering area in a south-western direction. The JOC said that aerial bombing had been delayed due to poor visibility. Mopping-up operations were finalised on the east side of the Outeniqua pass and would be monitored, while mopping-up would continue throughout the evening in Jonkersberg.
