An 18-year-old student identified as Hudson Rangel Gomes Rosa from Minas Gerais, Brazil, has been arrested for beating 17-year-old Luiz Felipe Siqueira de Sousa to death at the Education Institute of Minas Gerais. Local media reports the victim and suspect got into a fight during a football match at break time. It’s alleged Hudson beat up Luiz from behind. The victim was reportedly carried through the playground by his friends and was rushed to Joao XXIII Hospital. Luiz later died from his injuries. Hudson has been arrested and placed in preventative custody as the investigation into the incident is ongoing. The victim’s aunt, Valdenia Evangelista, who looked after him since he was three years old, said she’s forgiven the suspect. "His life was studying, cycling and football,” Valdenia said. “Luiz was very calm. He was a boy we never had to worry about because he was very kind. He helped out around the house. “He’ll never be forgotten. He’s a boy who planted and gathered love wherever he went he." The Director of the school, Alexandra Aparecida Morais, said the suspect had a history of violence. "There were a lot of them. Over 30,” Alexandra said. “Aggression, unwelcome behaviour with colleagues and talking in class."    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
