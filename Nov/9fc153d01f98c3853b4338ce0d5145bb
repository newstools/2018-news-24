This area has been without power since the theft. "As all north- and southbound lanes will be closed, traffic congestion and delays can be expected between 08:00 and 10:00 [on Friday]. "The Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) and Umngeni Municipal Traffic will manage traffic accommodation during the closure and N3TC’s Route Patrol Teams will be on standby to provide further assistance."
