"This is a victory for the learners of Uitzig High School, as they will now move to neighbouring schools where there are better facilities and resources," said Education MEC Debbie Schäfer. The School Governing Body (SGB) had wanted the school to stay open and for the department to fix it, after it was repeatedly targeted by vandals and thieves.

Schäfer said she had decided to close the school, with the pupils' best interests in mind. She said court action by the SGB to try and stop the closure had delayed implementing the decision for almost two years. The school's matric pass rate dropped from 70.6% in 2016 to 20% in 2017. There are 87 pupils left at the school, 13 of whom are in matric. The current pupils would be accommodated at alternative schools in time for the start of the 2019 academic year, Schäfer said. The pupils could also apply for fee exemptions at their new schools, she added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
