Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has,” these were the sentiments expressed by a small group of activists from Ban Animal Trading (Bat) as they peacefully protested the use of fireworks on Chota Motala Road over the weekend. Obtaining a permit from the Mountain Rise Police Station, the activists staged the first ever #BanTheBang peaceful protest on Saturday, highlighting their issues against fireworks. “Fireworks cause extensive damage to the air in a short amount of time leaving metal particles, dangerous toxins and smoke in the air for hours. They are also terrifying for domestic animals as they can hear about seven times better than humans,” said Bat activist, Rekash Sinanin. The protestors urged those engaging in Diwali celebrations through firework to think of all the effects they have on the environment and animals before proceeding. “Please be kind to mother Earth, our environment, animals and humans, and use one of the many silent alternatives to fireworks for your celebrations,” urged Sinanin. He added that they will be protesting the use of fireworks again this Saturday, November 3, and then will focus their attention on the use of fireworks on New Year’s     Day.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
