Endley was sentenced to death on February 12 for espionage and conspiring to overthrow the government. "We extend our gratitude to President Kiir to release one of our own to once again spend time with his family," said Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu. She appealed to South Africans who had opportunities to work abroad, to observe and respect the laws of the countries they served.
