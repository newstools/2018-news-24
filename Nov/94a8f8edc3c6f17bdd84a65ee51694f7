It is alleged that this was the second time in one week that the suspect tried to burgle the house. “One of our armed response officers, Quinton Koll, was on patrol in the suburb when he received a notification about an alarm activation in Henley Road. We use an auto dispatch system, meaning that the officer closest to an alarm signal is automatically alerted,” explained Ryan Britz, Port Elizabeth branch manager at Fidelity ADT. When Koll arrived at the home, he found that the resident had already successfully apprehended the alleged suspect. The suspect was handcuffed and police were called to the scene. “It was after further investigation that it became clear that the suspect had allegedly burgled that same house earlier in the week. What he did not know, was that the home owner had subsequently installed an alarm system which clearly caught him by surprise,” said Britz. “My advice to people of Port Elizabeth is to make sure homes are properly secured and that any home alarm system is tested regularly to make sure it works. If you need any assistance, please contact your private security company.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
