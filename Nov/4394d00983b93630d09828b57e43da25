"A couple (both doctors) were asleep when the suspects broke into their house and attacked them. The male doctor was in the process shot at and the perpetrators managed to get away with a television set and cellphones," police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe told News24. They also made off with an undisclosed amount of cash. He says the suspects proceeded to a neighbouring house where they attacked another couple, shooting the husband and assaulting his wife with a sharp object. "The couple was also robbed of a television set, cellphones, tablet, laptops and an amount of cash," Ngoepe said. READ: Limpopo doctors shot in house robbery One of the doctors is in intensive care.
