CONGRATULATIONS to Greytown’s very own Angus Buchan, who recently received Best-selling Author of the Year award from Cum books at their annual authors breakfast in Vereeniging. The award was to commend Buchan for the exceptional sales of his books in the South African market and to thank him for his contribution to proclaim the gospel through scripture-based publications that inspire, enrich spiritually, and glorify       God. “This is based on the sales of all his books, English and Afrikaans, during the past year,” said Sua du Plessis, head of publications at Christian Art/Cum.
