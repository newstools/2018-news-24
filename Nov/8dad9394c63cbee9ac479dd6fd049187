The former Paralympic champion was granted "compassionate leave" to attend the service. According to the department, the request was processed in accordance with the departmental policy on "Amenities of Inmates", where compassionate leave is granted to attend funerals, or when there is a serious sick­ness and it is expected that the person is dying. "This concession is only granted when it concerns a direct family member (father, mother, child, spouse, bro­ther, sister, grandfather and grandmother)," spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said.

"These include, but are not limited to, an inmate classified as low risk, demonstrates good behaviour and be actively involved in rehabilitation programmes," he said. Pistorius had been escorted to the memorial and was now back behind bars, Nxumalo said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
