The City on Wednesday announced that it set aside Thursday morning to dispose of 16 926 bottles of alcohol amounting to nearly 12 000 litres. The City's law enforcement department is expected to head up the disposal as part of its operational readiness plan for the festive season, which takes effect annually in late November.
