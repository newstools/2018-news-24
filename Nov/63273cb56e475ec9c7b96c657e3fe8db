Recognised unions at the broadcaster picketed outside SABC offices throughout the country on Friday and submitted a memorandum, demanding that the SABC stop its planned staff cuts. In a statement issued on Friday, the public broadcaster said it "noted the peaceful picketing which took place at its various offices around the country by unions". The SABC said it would engage with unions "in a meeting scheduled for Tuesday (November 13)". The unions have slammed the SABC's restructuring plans and have demanded in a letter at Friday's demonstration that the broadcaster finds alternative ways of generating revenue and keep jobs. Communication Workers' Union representative Aubrey Tshabalala warned that "retrenchments should not be on the table for any reason, but a new funding model for the SABC". He also demanded that the broadcaster respond to their grievances by November 16 or face "a full-blown strike" and a "shutdown of the SABC".  #SABC GCEO Madoda Mxakwe tells workers that their memorandum will be attended to. @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/Rnl2o9AsZQ  #SABC Those picketing here hold placards written " Don't retrench workers, rather stop corruption", and "we demand a better funding model for SABC", among others. @TeamNews24 pic.twitter.com/zbDyaZJKaG 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
