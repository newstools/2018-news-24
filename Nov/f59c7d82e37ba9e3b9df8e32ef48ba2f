Tshidi Madia and Pieter du Toit Malusi Gigaba has resigned on Tuesday as minister of home affairs “for the sake of the country and the movement to which he belongs", according to a statement from the Presidency. Transport Minister Blade Nzimande will be acting minister of home affairs. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in the statement: "Minister Gigaba indicated in his letter of resignation that he was stepping aside for the sake of our country and the movement to which he belongs. "Further to relieve the President from undue pressure and allow him to focus on improving the lives of the people of South Africa and for him to do the best he can to serve the country and save it from this economic meltdown." Ramaphosa thanked Gigaba for his "longstanding service to the government and people of South Africa". Gigaba has been under fire in recent weeks after the Supreme Court of Appeal and the Constitutional Court upheld an earlier finding that he lied to the High Court in the Fireblade saga. The Public Protector also recommended that Ramaphosa take action against the minister in terms of the Executive Members’ Ethics Act. Besides Gigaba’s political travails, he was also embarrassed after a video leaked which showed him in a sexual act. It was reported over the weekend that Gigaba met with Ramaphosa last week in an attempt to smooth over the fallout of the court judgments. He allegedly told the president that he never lied and that his full account of events were never taken into consideration. Phone calls to Gigaba’s spokesperson as well as Khusela Diko, Ramaphosa’s spokesperson went unanswered.
