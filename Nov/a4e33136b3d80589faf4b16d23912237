READ: Grade 11 pupil arrested for allegedly killing Grade 1 pupil after fallout with the child's older sister The Mankala Technical High School pupil allegedly hid in the toilets of the primary school overnight on Tuesday. The deceased was apparently one of the first to go to the toilet on Wednesday morning, when the teenager pounced allegedly stabbing the child repeatedly. According to the Department of Education, the Grade 11 pupil appeared to be romantically involved with the Grade 1 pupil's older sister. "It is believed the couple may have had a fallout and the alleged perpetrator targeted the younger brother. However, police will conduct a full investigation around the circumstance of this horrific murder," education spokesperson, Elijah Mhlanga, said on Wednesday. Gina pleaded in Thursday's statement: "Education is a societal issue. We need to reinforce it into our children that violence is not the solution. They cannot solve challenges by becoming violent. A family is now robbed of a young life, who will never realise his life's promise."
