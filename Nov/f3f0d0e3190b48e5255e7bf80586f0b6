The premises of a finance company and a doctor’s surgery on Marine Drive, in Margate, were severely damaged during the incident. Police said they received the complaint at approximately 8.25pm on Saturday evening. During the collision, one of the vehicles crashed into a store, causing severe damages to the front window. An employee at the store who asked to remain anonymous said the shop will be unable to operate until the damages are rectified. “Although not much else beside the glass windows were affected, the office remains vacant now, making it impossible to operate in,” said the employee. She said the landlord had been made aware of the accident and proceedings have commenced to decide who would be taking up the costs for the damages. Police said, upon their arrival, the vehicles involved in the collision had already been towed. A Toyota Prada, which allegedly belonged to one of the business owners on the road, had allegedly collided with a white Toyota Corolla, which also damaged a grey Renault Cleo. “The driver of the Toyota Prada was not on the scene and the driver of the Toyota Corolla was taken by a friend to the police station,” said Margate SAPS spokesperson Captain Gerald Mfeka. Margate detectives are investigating a case of reckless and negligent driving. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
