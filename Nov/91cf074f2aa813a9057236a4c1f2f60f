Collin Bob (23) from Marydale was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for rapes he committed in 2015 and 2017 in the Marydale area. The sentence was passed by the Prieska Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, 6 November. The first incident took place in the early hours of the morning on 24 September 2015, when a 64-year-old female victim was accosted by Bob, dragged into the veld and raped. She was on her way home from a local tavern. Bob returned to the victim’s house exactly two years later, kicked open the door to her house and raped her again while she was in bed. He was arrested hours later by the police in Marydale and remained in custody until his sentencing. His DNA linked him to both crimes. Det. Const. Elrico Kiewiedo of the The SAPS lauds all the members involved in this case and a special thanks to D/Cst of Prieska Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit was the investigating officer.
