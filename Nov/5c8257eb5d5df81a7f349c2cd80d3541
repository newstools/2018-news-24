before white farmers, Ben Gilpin, director of the Commercial Farmers Union
(CFU) has told News24. On Thursday Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that $53
million had been allocated in the 2019 budget to compensate white
farmers. That figure is far below the at least $9 billion the farmers say
they are owed. Gilpin said that settling compensation issues with foreign
nationals who had trade agreements (known as BIPPAs) with Zimbabwe was likely
to be seen as a priority. Restoring international relations "Settlement of these matters (BIPPAs) is clearly a
prerequisite to restoring international relationships," Gilpin said. There's no confirmation that that is what President Emmerson
Mnangagwa’s government intends to do. But if it does, it will disappoint many
of Zimbabwe's 4 000 or so white farmers who've been hoping for compensation for
the homes and infrastructure they lost. "Many hundreds of claimants have died without any recourse,"
Gilpin said. News24 understands that 40 Dutch farmers, who were protected
by BIPPAs, have been trying for years to get compensation of around $25 million from the Zimbabwe government. It's not clear whether they will be
given precedence. Massive compensation claim It’s also unclear whether the money pledged under the 2019
budget will be denominated in real US dollars, or in Zimbabwe’s electronic
money, currently trading at a significant discount of around 3:1 to the US on
the black market. Gilpin told News24 that dialogue between the CFU and
government is ongoing. "We hope that a win-win solution can be found that solves
both compensation and ensures economic recovery," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
