Canny Maphanga Robbers with a taste for a specific brand of watches robbed Jade Jewellers at East Rand Mall on Monday. The South African Police Service (SAPS) said armed robbers went into the store under the guise of being customers searching for a particular watch. "The shop assistant went to the display cabinet. The suspect produced a crow bar and smashed the glass cabinet and took only TAG Heuer watches and then fled," police spokesperson Captain Pearl van Staad said in a statement.
