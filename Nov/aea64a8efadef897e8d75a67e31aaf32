A fourth person was also arrested after the chase and later, a fifth person was found hiding in a garden and apprehended. Traut attributed the arrests to the quick response of the police and the K9 unit, which sprang into action when they received the call about the robbery at a shop in Koeberg Road at about 08:50. When they got there, they saw armed men fleeing in a Toyota Prado and a Toyota Corolla.
