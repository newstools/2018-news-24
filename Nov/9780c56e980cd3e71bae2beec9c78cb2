FEMALE pupils from Bethel Junior Secondary, a rural school in Matatiele, were delighted when they received sanitary towels, donated by the Red Cross, recently. As a non-profit organisation, Red Cross has a mission to try and keep young girls in school. Most young girls from poor families lack sanitary towels, which is what prompted this initiative. The NPO visited the school to hand over the sanitary towels and offer life orientation lessons to the female pupils. “We would like to thank the Red Cross for assisting our pupils,” said school principal, Michael Nketle.
