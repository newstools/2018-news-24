Sarah Evans A fourth suspect has been arrested in connection with the
murder of a 54-year-old man in Welkom last weekend. Shai Mohapi was shot at close range in his car in broad
daylight while waiting in the parking lot of a shopping centre. The murder was caught on CCTV cameras. Police spokesperson Brigadier Sam Makhele told News24 on Thursday
morning that a fourth suspect was arrested on Wednesday night. He said police
were expecting more arrests and that the investigation was at a preliminary
stage. Because of the preliminary nature of the investigation,
Makhele said it was not clear when the four would appear in court, and could
not divulge what the roles of the other two suspects were in the crime. TimesLive reported on Wednesday night that a firearm –
believed to be the murder weapon - was confiscated when the first three
suspects were arrested. Only two of the suspects appear in the CCTV footage. Makhele said the suspects range from ages 27-29. READ: Man shot dead in car in mall parking lot Mohapi was reportedly shot three times in the chest and

offer support to Mohapi's family.
