Riaan Grobler A man in his 20s died on a farm in the Vergezocht area outside Bloemfontein on Thursday while repairing a faulty security light. According to a statement by Trauma Response Africa spokesperson Stanley Schimper, the man, who was working as an electrician, had climbed on to a grain silo tower to repair the light. "The owner of the farm passed by and saw the lifeless body of the man lying on the tower and alerted emergency services who responded to the scene. "On arrival the man was examined, but it was found that he had already passed away and that there was nothing more that could be done to save him," Schimper said. Members of the Mangaung Fire and Rescue Services, assisted by members of the Free State College of Emergency care and Trauma Response Africa, set up a high-angle rope-rescue system and lowered the body of the man to the ground from the 20m-high tower in a recovery effort that continued well into the night. "The cause of his death is not yet known and is being investigated by the SAPS," Schimper said.
