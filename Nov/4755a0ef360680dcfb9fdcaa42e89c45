POLICE in KwaZulu-Natal are making an appeal to women in the province to be alert at all times and not fall victim to con artists who target them for their hard-earned money. Con artists who target older, widowed, or divorced women typically pretend to be attracted to their victims, forming a relationship with them before robbing them of their savings. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said: “They would influence them to resign from their employment for better investment opportunities or convince them to consult a ‘traditional doctor’ who assists with multiplying cash using ‘black magic’. Women have fallen victim to such modus operandi and it is not easy to investigate cases where there has been an agreement of exchange of cash in a romantic relationship. Women are warned to be vigilant at all times and not trust anyone with their life savings.” — Supplied
