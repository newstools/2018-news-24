rapist Nicholas Ninow (20) was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in January 2013. Nicholas appeared for the second time in
the magistrate’s court in Pretoria this morning on charges relating to the rape
of a seven-year-old girl in the restroom of a Dros restaurant in Silverton,
Pretoria, in September. At one point during the court proceedings this
morning Nicholas sat down in the dock. The magistrate instructed him to stand
up again. It emerged in court that Nicholas had been
admitted to a treatment facility for drug abuse. During this morning’s proceedings Nicholas
was referred to nearby Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital for psychiatric
evaluation. The state will be appointing a clinical psychologist and a team of
experts to evaluate him. The court also received the test results of
the DNA samples gathered on the scene – but these results won’t be revealed to
the media. Because the victim is a minor, the state
requested that if a hearing does take place it should be in camera. “We’re very upset [about the prospect of
the victim having to testify in court]. [It doesn’t make sense] that someone so
young [should] be put through the added trauma of testifying in court. That’s
what the DNA evidence is for,” says Bea Campbell-Cloete, a DA representative. Nicholas will remain custody until his next
court appearance later this month. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
