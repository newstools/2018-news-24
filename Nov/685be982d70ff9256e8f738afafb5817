Fever Reporter THE 28-year-old suspect linked to the murder of a teacher from Katkop, near Mount Fletcher who appeared in the Qumbu Magistrate’s Court earlier this week has abandoned his bail application. “The suspect is facing charges of murder, kidnapping and hijacking the vehicle of the murdered teacher. The body of the teacher was pointed out by the suspect,” said SAPS spokesperson Captain Raphael Motloung. The suspect made his first court appearance on October 26. “When the suspect was arrested, he was driving a vehicle belonging to the teacher, whom he later confessed to have killed. “The teacher was reported missing after attending a church service at Tshikitsha village, in Katkop. “She was last seen driving a Toyota [bakkie] fitted with a canopy, but she never arrived home,” said Motloung. Relatives of the teacher managed to track the missing vehicle’s location and it was indicated that the vehicle was near Mthatha. SAPS intervened and arrested the suspect, who also had cellphones belonging to the teacher in his possession. “When the suspect was questioned, he claimed that the owner of the vehicle gave it to him to keep it safe, however during the process of investigation, the suspect decided to show police the location of the teacher’s body, which was recovered with signs of being strangled,” Motloung said. Eastern Cape National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Luxolo Tyali said the case has been postponed to January 15, 2019 for further investigations. The suspect has abandoned his bail application, meaning he will remain in custody until his next appearance. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
