Monday in connection with the killing of seven women and children in a house in
Vlakfontein. Fifita Khupe, 61, and a 27-year-old suspect appeared in the
Lenasia Magistrate's Court last Monday on seven counts of premeditated murder,
with the second suspect also facing three counts of rape. They also face an additional charge of theft, as they were
found with the bank cards of the deceased. The police found the bodies of three women and four children
buried under sand in a house in Vlakfontein on October 29, after neighbours
noticed a strange stench from the house. The younger suspect was allegedly romantically involved with
one of the murder victims, although the motive for the murders is yet to be
determined. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
