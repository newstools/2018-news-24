Rinquest was reading a letter written by a student, Siphelele Qabaza, in the Eastern Cape who attends one of the problem schools with bad infrastructure that Equal Education has identified, GroundUp reported. "We never wanted much. We just want to feel the joy in our schools with no fear of falling structures and feel warm in classrooms with no broken windows. The National Department of Education complains about the pass rate in the Eastern Cape knowing that they do not give learners proper places to study," Rinquest read from the letter. The panel discussion was part of the closing night of Equal Education's anniversary exhibition "Qina Mfundi. Qina!", at the Tshisimani Centre for Activist Education in Mowbray on Thursday, under the theme Ten Years of Struggle for Equal Education. The panel discussed the challenges to quality teaching and learning in rural areas as well as some of the successes for Equal Education in fighting for better education. Rinquest said in the last three years there had been some improvement in the department of education in the Eastern Cape but added that there were still systematic issues. No water at 197 Eastern Cape schools "There are still large backlogs and information gaps," said Rinquest. GroundUp has written a number of stories on the conditions of schools in the Eastern Cape, with some children using a field as a toilet and others having to deal with snakes coming into their classrooms. Rinquest said of the 5 000 schools in Eastern Cape, 197 have no water, 53 have no toilets, 2 127 only have pit toilets and 245 have no electricity. "Now these are the numbers that [the Department of Basic Education is] proud of, I don't know how they can be proud of the fact that there are schools where there is not a single toilet," said Rinquest. She said in many cases when they visit the schools they find different information than what the department provided. The Department of Basic Education set norms and standards for South African school infrastructure in 2013, and provided its own deadline to fix the infrastructure standards by 2016, which it failed to meet. Overcrowding Equal Education campaigned against the missed deadline and when the department failed to engage Equal Education, it took the department to court. Equal Education won the case in the High Court in Bhisho in July 2018. "The 2016 date has come and passed, 2017 came and passed and the 2018 date has come and passed. There are still over 2 000 schools without toilets," said Rinquest, talking about the deadlines for the school norms and standards implementations. Katiso Mosioua, a teacher at Chief Henry Bokleni High School in Libode, 34km from Mthatha, said they were happy with assistance from Equal Education which helped them get a state of the art school that was finished in June this year. "In the previous school we experienced overcrowding with a class compliment of 98 students for one teacher, we had 1 500 students for 17 classes. It was difficult for teachers who had to mark 98 papers for one class and that affected the pass rate" said Mosioua. He said they had not yet moved into the new school because there was no electricity, despite them having applied for it in 2014. He said the school is looking into getting generators so that the students can move into the new school in 2019. Scholar transport victory Equal Education Law Centre attorney Demichelle Petherbridge spoke about the victories in advocating for scholar transport in KwaZulu-Natal since 2014. Equal Education had taken the department to court, asking that they provide scholar transport for 12 schools in Nquthu in rural KwaZulu-Natal. On November 7, 2017, the KwaZulu-Natal departments of education and transport promised in court that from April 1, 2018, all of the 12 schools would be getting transport. "The rights to basic education includes the ability to actually have access to a school and that failure to provide scholar transport is a violation to the right to basic education," said Petherbridge. "The state has a duty to provide scholar transport as part of its constitutional mandate." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
