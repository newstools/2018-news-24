car crash in 2006 has woken up from a 12-year-long coma. Wang Shuboa (48), from Shouguang in eastern China, came round to see tears streaming down
his elderly mom’s face, Mirror News
reports. Wei Mingying (75) has been taking care of her son
for more than a decade and has spent all her savings on his medical expenses, leaving
her ¥159 000 (around R320 000) in debt. Wei told local media she’s gone up to a month without eating and weighs only 28kg. “My mouth, my tongue was all dry. I’d just drink
water,” she said. Wang’s father passed away when he was young, leaving
Wei as the sole provider for her family, Newsweek
reports. The doting mother said over the past decade her
day, which starts at 5am, has consisted of bathing and feeding Wang via a
stomach tube, giving him a massage and
repositioning him to prevent bedsores. In October she noticed her son give a slight smile,
indicating that he’s regaining consciousness. She said he’s unable to move or speak but smiles in
response to what she does, News.au
reports. “I’m just overjoyed,” Wei said. “I hope he’ll make
a full recovery. I’ll never give up on him. I hope he can call me Mom again one
day.” Sources: Mirror News,
