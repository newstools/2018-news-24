In a tweet on Wednesday, Malema hit back following Tuesday's dramatic sitting in Parliament where he and DA chief whip John Steenhuisen exchanged rough words. The chaos started when Ramaphosa answered a question Steenhuisen posed. Ramaphosa expressed his concern about Steenhuisen's auditory and cognitive abilities. "I think we have a problem with the honourable Steenhuisen," Ramaphosa said. When Steenhuisen rose for a point of order, EFF MPs howled at him. "Can the VBS looters give me a chance to speak?" Steenhuisen replied. That is when all hell broke loose prompting Malema to bellow at Steenhuisen: "You're a racist white man accused of rape!" DA MPs started chanting: "Pay back the money!" The EFF replied:"Racist!" Following the end of the sitting, House Chairperson Thoko Didiza said she would reflect on the events, saying many rules had been broken.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
