"The opportunity to apply is applicable to all South African citizens wishing to enroll for the first time in 2019 and returning South African students who were never funded by NSFAS for undergraduate studies," spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo said in a statement on Friday. NSFAS has warned that after midnight on Sunday the website will stop accepting any further applications. "The weekend window should be used as an opportunity for those with missing supporting documents to submit. We encourage all new applicants to ensure that they attach all the necessary documents the first time," Mamabolo added. Applications were opened in September and were initially scheduled to close on November 30, prior to the extensions.

"We hope that applicants will use this weekend to ensure that they submit everything required so that their funding decision is not delayed. Those that must resubmit documents should do so speedily," Mamabolo concluded. NSFAS further wishes to clarify that the weekend extension only applies to online applications and not to applications that are submitted at the National Youth Development Agency's offices nationwide. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
