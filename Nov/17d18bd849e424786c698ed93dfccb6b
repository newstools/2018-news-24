A team of more than 15 residents embarked on a clean-up campaign last Sunday, collecting more than 1 000 bags of refuse. Community leader Maxwell Ndunge told Coastal Weekly: “Our clean-up campaign still faces minor problems at the lower levels. “We are short of active community members collecting the dirt in the area. “Another thing that puts us off is the shortage of plastic bags. Our appeal is to get the council to supply us with enough bags.” Ndunge appealed to the residents to avoid littering around the area. “We are considering having educational awareness programmes for the residents of Umbhayi. Some community members are not clued up on matters pertaining to maintaining a good environment,” Ndunge said. Ward councillor Dolly Munien said that, since the inception of the project, some residents have been proactive in cleaning up their streets. “The clean-up which I was part of was a great success. “Over the years, the number of the Umbhayi residents has been growing rapidly, and that caused over-population. We are sitting in a situation where the municipality is unable to supply all the residents with big bags because some of the residents are currently not in the database. “I will make an urgent application to the municipality to supply all the residents with big bags,” Munien said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
