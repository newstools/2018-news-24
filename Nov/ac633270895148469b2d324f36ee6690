As a leading provider of secure student accommodation, CampusKey offers students everything they need under one roof so that they can focus on their main objective – to graduate and have fun at the same time. Raised in Uitenhage, Karsan completed her BA degree in legal theory and psychology at Rhodes University before moving to the NMU in Port Elizabeth to complete her LLB. “Each campus boasts a friendly, dedicated student connector, as well as mentors to ensure students’ happiness and success,” she said. “I’m excited to have been selected as a CampusKey mentor next year and believe it suits me well considering how much I love the place! “I applied for the position as I always wanted to be part of the house committee, both during my stay at res in Grahamstown and here. “I love challenging myself and believe this will offer me the opportunity to grow,” she said. Karsan admitted that she did not know what to expect when she arrived at CampusKey at the beginning of this year. “But I haven’t looked back since. The atmosphere is fun, vibrant and homely. I love the fact that I’m always meeting new faces from around the world. I’d definitely recommend CampusKey to anyone. “It’s your home away from home and offers everything you need under one roof! The staff and students are friendly and you can see that they genuinely care about you.” She hopes to facilitate more integration among students during her mentor year. “I find that students tend to form cliques and stick to them for the rest of the semester. “For introverts or shy students, it’s hard to make friends. “I want to introduce students to each other at our free weekly events and be there for them when the going gets tough. Students can ask me anything, from advice to some daily inspiration.” Karsan has also made quite a name for herself as an entrepreneur in the world of bespoke fashion, having launched Nix’s Kix as a hobby in December 2015, with her business growing in leaps and bounds ever since. With other achievements such as earning her Shodan black belt in karate and graduating from Rhodes in 2017, she’s set to accomplish her goals. Three lucky students stand the chance of winning their accommodation for next year at their Bloemfontein, Potchefstroom or Port Elizabeth campuses, valued at R65 000.
