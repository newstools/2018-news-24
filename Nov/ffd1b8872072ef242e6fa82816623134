Christina Pitt A popular hikers' camp spot at Constantia Nek, Cape Town, has been closed until the end of the summer season following a string of incidents over the last two months. SanParks spokesperson Saskia Marlowe explained that guests staying at Orange Kloof Tented Camp and those who take guided walks in the area had become targets for criminals over the last 60 days. "We are closing provisionally until the end of March 2019. We're going to take a bit of a financial knock, but we need to put our guests' safety first," she said. "We will be erecting an electric fence and we'll be doing a few other things as well." Table Mountain Watch spokesperson Andre van Schalkwyk said that guests camping in the area were robbed this week. "Visitors were robbed overnight, so it will be too risky to open it up," he said. Marlowe confirmed the incident and added that only luggage had been stolen and that no one had been injured. Western Cape police did not have further details on the incident that occurred this week.
