Govender who lives in the CBD entered the competition in December last year and she has been doing so well that she made it to the finals, set to take place on December 17 at the Barnyard Theatre, Suncoast Casino, from 7pm. Speaking to the Echo, Govender said she is very confident that she will bring the crown home but having more people vote for her will increase her chances of winning. “Even though I am still trying to come to terms with the fact that I am a finalist, I know I am ready for this competition but I will also need votes from my people in Pietermaritzburg. “What makes this competition even more special for me is that it is my first national competition and it took so much courage for me to enter it. “It is like a dream come true for me. “I am pleading with people to please vote for me. I can already see myself on that stage, being announced as a winner,” she said. “When I saw this competition, I saw it as something that will help me learn a lot and be able to come and plant back whatever I have learnt in the competition to the young girls in my city of Pietermaritzburg. “It is not only about modelling but it also teaches us how to handle life, teaches us about businesses, and about being future leaders.” To vote for Govender SMS Lorraine to 35334.
