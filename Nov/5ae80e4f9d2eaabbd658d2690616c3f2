GIFT Zungu claims he and co-accused have been arrested for Musawenkosi “Maqatha” Mchunu’s murder because of their political ties. Zungu said that his mother, Funcwana Zungu — the uMgungundlovu District Municipality deputy mayor — has been viewed as the “standard bearer” of the faction that was deemed to be in opposition to Mchunu’s. However, he claims that Mchunu was treated like family and had frequented his home. Zungu’s affidavit about why he should be granted bail was read out in the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court by his advocate, Jerome Brauns, SC, yesterday. He is charged along with his cousin Nkosinathi “TK” Gambu, Nkanyiso Zimu, Sifiso Mbele, and Ayanda Ngubane. “All of us had become unwitting victims of the last presidential battle between Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and the incumbent president Cyril Ramaphosa,” he said. All six men have given the court similar reasons why they should be released on bail: they believe their arrests were politically motivated. They are adamant they will stand trial so that the “truth” can come out. The bail application continues tomorrow.
