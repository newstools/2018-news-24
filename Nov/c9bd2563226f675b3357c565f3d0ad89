On Monday, it released its latest video titled "You People" and it is already causing a huge stir. The ad contains a variety of hilarious scenes in which South Africans typically stereotype one another based on their appearance, accents, habits and tastes. It even features a "black Adam Katzavelos" who seemingly can't pronounce the word 'beach' properly. Nando's said in a statement that "You people" is a phrase often used by South Africans when describing people who are different to them. "So, in the ad from M&C Saatchi Abel, Nando's highlights the ways in which South Africans typically stereotype one another and the hypocrisies that go with that. "It's a phrase that goes hand in hand with an unconscious bias. It's used in jest, as a slight and even in outright confrontation — and many South Africans are likely to have used the phrase at one time or another. We've all been guilty, some more than others, of you-peopling us people. It's what makes you people all the same, Nonke! "A year ago we reminded South Africans that we can fix our sh!t and this 'you-peopling' is something we can all fix," said Doug Place, Nando's chief marketing officer. "If you're watching our ad and say 'I've done that' (hopefully with a guilty smile), then we've been successful at starting a crucial conversation — hopefully one that starts with 'us people'."
