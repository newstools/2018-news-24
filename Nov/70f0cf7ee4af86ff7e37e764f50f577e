Speaking to a large crowd of commuters at Ematsheni Taxi Rank and Freedom Square Centre, he said it is important for people to understand that the ANC does not belong to any individual but it belongs South Africa. As he addressed them, supporters cheered on in agreement. “ANC is not an individual. If a person takes an individual and makes it more important than the ANC, then that person is not politically wise. The ANC is more important than an individual,” Zuma said. He then asked supporters to stop punishing the ANC because of certain individuals within the organisation, saying: “If there is an individual that you differ with, you need to put your differences aside, go and vote and make sure that the ANC wins. After the elections come back, sit down and sort out your differences.” He said ANC members need to stand together and fight to make sure that they succeed in the next year’s election. “Opposition parties are doing all sorts of things to ensure that the ANC gets less votes so that it could be forced to enter into a coalition after next year’s elections. “They want to weaken the ANC so that they can take the country in the wrong direction. “We need to ensure that the ANC wins the elections so that we will be able to defend our freedom and policies,” Zuma said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
