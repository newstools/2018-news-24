JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the man targeted a female officer who was attending driver training on Friday. The instructor apparently offered her lessons for payment in kind. "He then instructed the female officer to book a place for them in Mondeor, south of Johannesburg for a massage treatment and once that was done he will offer her free driving lessons. JMPD Internal Affairs was informed by the Academy and a sting operation was conducted," said Minnaar.

"The instructor was caught almost in action at [a] Bed and Breakfast. A case of extortion is opened at Mondeor police station which will be followed by an internal disciplinary process. Corruption of any nature will not be tolerated in JMPD. #BuyaMthetho starts with us," said Minnaar. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
