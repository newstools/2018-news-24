"We are convinced that the activism of Cde Sochayile as a seasoned activist of the mass democratic movement will bring invaluable organisational experience in the ANC caucus in the GPL," provincial secretary Jacob Khawe said in a statement on Tuesday. Khanyile’s appointment comes after the resignation of former chief whip Brian Hlongwa last Tuesday. "This decision has been informed by the need to resolve the eight-year long accusations, without having the matter aired in the courts of the country," Hlongwa said in a statement last week. READ: Brian Hlongwa steps down as ANC chief whip in Gauteng legislature Hlongwa, along with other government officials, has been implicated in a report by the specialised investigative unit (SIU) into corrupt activities to the tune of R1.2bn during his tenure as health MEC, News 24 reported earlier. According to the ANC in Gauteng, Khanyile brings with him a "wealth of experience as a public representative", dating back to 1995. "He then proceeded to join the ANC caucus in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature as secretary to caucus in 2008, joining the GPL as a Member of the Provincial Legislature from 2014 to date," Khawe explained. The ANC wished its newly appointed chief whip well in his "important role". "We are confident that he will steer the ANC caucus in the GPL to greater heights," he said.
