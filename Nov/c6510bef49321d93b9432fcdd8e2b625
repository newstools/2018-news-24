In heeding the Thuma Mina call by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the senior leadership of the Ray Nkonyeni municipality, led by mayor Nomusa Mqwebu together with councillors, cleaned up Emashembeni along the main Harding Road, near Murchison, recently. Hundreds of passing motorists and members of the public witnessed the leadership in action as they donned their gloves and picked up several bags of litter from the area. “The ANC welcomes the municipality’s tough stance on illegal dumping and we urge all our communities to be part of their efforts towards ensuring cleaner, safer communities,” said Selvan Chetty from the party. “We want to also thank the many community volunteers who sacrificed their time to assist in the clean-up campaign,” said Chetty.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
