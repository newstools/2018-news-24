His wife sustained multiple injuries, ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said in a statement. Vermaak said paramedics arrived on the scene before 08:00 on Friday and found a bakkie on its side. "Bystanders explained that it appeared as if the light motor vehicle had broken down shortly before the collision occurred. Both elderly occupants from the light motor vehicle were outside of it when the bakkie overturned and rolled on top of them," he said Vermaak said the man was declared dead on the scene and the woman was treated for her injuries and taken to a nearby hospital. He said the driver of the bakkie was also taken to hospital. "The exact circumstances surrounding the collision and events leading up to the collision is not yet known. Local authorities attended the scene and will investigate," said Vermaak. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
