Ntambanana detectives arrested the two on Tuesday, police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said. The 44-year-old man has been charged with murder, while his 41-year-old sister has been charged with defeating the ends of justice. According to Mbele, the 58-year-old victim was walking home after having a drink with friends on Monday night in the neighbouring homestead of Ndondwane when tragedy struck. "He was allegedly followed by another male who was with a group of local males at that homestead. The suspect had allegedly assaulted the deceased to death with a knobkerrie and fled. He took out his bloodied clothes and his sister assisted him to conceal his clothes." The victim's body was found the next morning, prompting a murder investigation by police. "Both suspects will appear in the Ngwelezane Magistrate's Court soon," Mbele said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
