Spokesperson Neo Momodu said the independent commission had completed its work and presented its report to the broadcaster's board. "The SABC board accepted the commission's report in its entirety and has directed the executive directors to implement the recommendations," Momodu said.

The SABC, however, has not yet said if that process has been completed and when the findings and recommendations would be made known. The commissions came off the back of recommendations from an ad hoc parliamentary committee that was established to deal with instances of unlawful conduct within the broadcaster. Last week the SABC announced its intention to lay off 981 permanent employees and 1 200 freelancers as part of a restructuring process. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
