Stellenbosch student Hannah Cornelius’ cousin Lali van Zuydam has started a
fundraising campaign to help Cheslin Marsh, who was also attacked the night
Hannah was killed, get a hearing aid. Hannah and
her friend Cheslin, also a student, were hijacked and abducted in the early
hours of 26 May 2016. Cheslin was
viciously assaulted and left for dead. As well as head injuries and a broken
arm sustained in the assault, Cheslin also lost the hearing in his left ear. Lali told
radio station Cape Talk she’d started a crowdfund for Cheslin on Backabuddy.
Cheslin can’t afford a hearing aid and hasn’t been able to continue studying
since the attack, she says. “At first
we made the target R15 000 so we could support him. But so many people got
on board when they heard of the project we’ve raised R20 000. “We’ve
decided to put any additional funds into the Hannah Cornelius Foundation and
use that money to help Cheslin go back to university next year to resume his
studies.” When
Charnaé Pieterse from the Ear Institute in Belville, Cape Town, heard of the
Backabuddy campaign for Cheslin, the institute decided to sponsor Cheslin’s
hearing aid, as well as a comprehensive hearing test. A grateful
Lali says they’ll now use all the funds raised for Cheslin’s hearing aid to pay
his outstanding medical bills, as well as help get him back to university.  Since
speaking to Cape Talk, Lali says more than R20 000 has been raised and the
target has once again increased to R30 000.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
