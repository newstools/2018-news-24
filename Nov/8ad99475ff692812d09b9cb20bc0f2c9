Christina Pitt Tears Animal Rescue said it may have to evacuate its cats from their cattery as a fire in Sunnydale, Cape Town, edged closer to their premises on Monday. The rescue centre is located in the False Bay area to serve the communities of Ocean View, Masiphumelele, Red Hill and Capricorn. "We are on standby to evacuate, but the fire is contained. Fire and Rescue Services is doing a great job," Tears spokesperson Wendy Scheepers said. "If it flares up again, we will have all hands on deck for an evacuation." The non-profit organisation called, via its Facebook page, on all volunteers for assistance in the event that there was a need for an evacuation. Almost immediately, a number of cat lovers offered their support. Tears Animal Rescue is a non-profit organisation that takes care of abandoned, abused or neglected animals. Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Theo Layne was not available for comment.
