"The information is not yet clear, but we know that some chemicals do react to each other and can cause [an] explosion. But that will be investigated by the relevant authorities," he said. He added that it was alleged that there was a chemical reaction. Ntladi said sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and many other substances were in the area that could have caused the explosion. Five fire engines and about 25 firefighters were on the scene and the blaze has since been contained. "We are busy cooling off the hotspots," he said. Parts of the factory were completely destroyed. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
