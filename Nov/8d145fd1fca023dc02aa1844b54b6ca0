Reporter THE South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) has urged social grant beneficiaries, who are still in possession of the old SASSA card, to urgently swap it for the new gold card or run the risk of not getting their grants in January 2019. “SASSA beneficiaries who still use the old white SASSA card should get the new gold SASSA card as soon as possible, but no later than December 15, this year,” SASSA said in a statement. According to SASSA, the old card will expire on December 30, and SASSA will not be able to deposit any payments for January into these cards. “There are approximately 109 000 SASSA beneficiaries in the Eastern Cape who have not yet switched to the new card.” Beneficiaries who are still in possession of the old card can swap it at their nearest SASSA or post office. They have to bring along their ID and the old card. The process takes less than five minutes. “Special arrangements are made for disabled beneficiaries who cannot visit a post office. The beneficiaries (or their relatives) should call the toll-free number 0800 60 10 11 to arrange for a home visit.” The new gold card offers one free cash withdrawal per month over a post office counter and unlimited free swipes at all retailers to pay for purchases. It is necessary to use your PIN when swiping your card at a retailer, but the post office also caters for beneficiaries who are not comfortable using a PIN. These beneficiaries can present their ID document to make a withdrawal inside the post office, using biometric authentication instead of PIN to withdraw funds. – REPORTER 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
