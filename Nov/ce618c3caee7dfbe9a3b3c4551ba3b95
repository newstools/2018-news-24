On Friday the IEC approached the Electoral Court in a bid to postpone the by-election scheduled for November 21. According to the IEC's statement, the decision to postpone follows complaints received from political parties contesting the by-election that they had not received reasonable access to potential voters in the ward for campaigning purposes. "The complaints are related to the granting of access to registered voters residing on farms in the ward," said IEC spokesperson Kate Bapela. "The electoral commission decided to approach the court for a postponement in order to allow time to resolve the complaints and to ensure sufficient opportunity for all contestants to have reasonable access for purposes of canvassing all voters resident on farms ahead of the elections." Bapela added that the IEC filed a notice with the court seeking condonation to exceed the legal time frame of 90 days in which by-elections must be held. The 90-day time frame expires on December 7 2018. Ward 9 contains 3 431 registered voters and the vacancy arose as a result of the resignation of the councillor, Bapela said.         24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
