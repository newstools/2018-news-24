"Rescue Care paramedics were called to 151 Old Main Road in Pinetown with reports of a structural collapse with people trapped under rubble," operations director Garrith Jamieson said in a statement. "A mezzanine floor had collapsed, injuring the workers. On arrival, paramedics found that two employees were trapped under the flooring and the Durban Fire Department used the jaws of life and other tools to free the injured while advanced life support paramedics stabilised them." Once freed, the two were loaded into an awaiting ambulance before being transported to a nearby hospital, Jamieson said. "A total of 14 employees had sustained various injuries and were stabilised on the scene before they were all transported to various Durban hospitals for the further care that they required." SAPS Search and Rescue, Durban Fire Department, SAPS and Metro Police were all in on the scene, the statement read. "At this stage the events leading up to the flooring collapsing is unknown," Jamieson said. 14 Injured in structural collapse in Pinetown https://t.co/xUGI3MtT90 #ArriveAlive @rescuecare pic.twitter.com/Z5tpU8typ1  KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter. - FOLLOW News24 on Twitter 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
