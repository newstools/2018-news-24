suspected gang members are expected to appear in court on Monday after being
arrested in a takedown operation, Western
Cape police said on Sunday. A team of police members from different units
arrested the group, aged 25 to 36, in Kuils River in the early hours of Friday
morning, said Captain FC van Wyk. During the raid, officers visited six suspected
drug dens and seized a substantial amount of cash, two hard drives and
six cellphones. The group faces
over 100 charges in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Van Wyk said the investigation team included
officials from SARS and the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU), and would be guided by
a dedicated prosecutor. Provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General
Khombinkosi Jula welcomed the arrests, which were in line with his strategy to
target kingpins of organised criminal
groupings and seize their assets with the help of the AFU.      24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
