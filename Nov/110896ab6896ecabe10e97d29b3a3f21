Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andre Traut said the courier's van was hijacked by three gunmen in Sunbird Park, Kuils River, at 10:30 on Thursday. The hijackers then moved the parcels from the courier van to their blue Corsa and took off with the loot. Traut said the flying squad responded swiftly and, when they spotted the vehicle, gave chase. Shots were exchanged between police and the hijackers, and the driver of the Corsa eventually lost control and crashed on the R300, a busy arterial route.

The two will appear in the Kuils River Magistrate's Court soon.
