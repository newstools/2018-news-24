The gang allegedly committed numerous business robberies at fast food outlets, garage tuck shops and hair salons. Sometimes they would target more than one business at a time. An intelligence-driven operation, conducted by the cluster's trio task team and Crime Intelligence, resulted in the arrest of six people, police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said. "Cigarettes and cellphones that were taken during numerous business robberies were confiscated. The white Toyota Quantum minibus that was used during the robberies was recovered," she said. "Clothing was confiscated as evidence. The suspects were apparently seen on video footage during robberies wearing these clothing. Various types of ammunition and magazines were also found and confiscated." Those arrested, aged between 18 and 55, are allegedly linked to about 30 cases. They are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court soon on charges of business robbery and possession of stolen goods. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
