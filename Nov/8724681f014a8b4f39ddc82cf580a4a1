Sarah-Jayne Thomas, 28, and Tim Grace, 31, – both from South Wales – died after the vehicle they were in whizzed along the M4 at a speed of 161km/h and crashed into a nearby tree on 12 June, Mirror reports. Witnesses at the Miller and Carter steakhouse in Cardiff said they saw the pair drinking large amounts of alcohol, with the investigation finding that Tim’s blood-alcohol was twice the legal limit, Wales Online reports. Eyewitness Richard Fuge said he saw the BMW driving "at a very high speed". "I was driving at 113km/h and it passed me as if I was stationary. I'd say it was maxed out and couldn’t go any faster," he said. Tim – who worked as a window cleaner – started seeing Sarah-Jayne socially after she started working at the hairdresser below his flat and, according to his mother, was very "upbeat and happy" the day before their first official date, BBC reports. The pair each leave behind two kids under the age of ten. While the mother of two died at the scene, Tim – who was the driver of the vehicle – succumbed to his injuries the next day in hospital.
