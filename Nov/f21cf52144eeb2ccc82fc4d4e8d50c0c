The 22-year-old sported an accessory to his usual diamond earrings - a new hearing aid, sponsored by a Sea Point ear specialist. He heard Allie sentence Gerado Parsons, Vernon Witbooi and Eben van Niekerk to 25 years for their attempt on his life in May last year. "I'm just relieved that justice has been served. I can't describe how I feel â€“ I am just happy," he said, expressing his gratitude to all involved in "catching the guys" and bringing them to book. Witbooi, Parsons and Van Niekerk were sentenced to life imprisonment for Cornelius' murder, and life behind bars for her rape. The pair also received 15 years for four counts of robbery and 10 years for the kidnapping of Marsh, Cornelius and Mimi October.

Dr Taurai Gororo of Tygerberg Hospital, who had examined him, testified that he was lucky to be alive. He suffered severe head injuries and lost the ability to hear in in his left ear. But he considered Hannah's death as the biggest loss he experienced that morning.

She had insisted on driving him home after a night out in the student town.

(Tammy Petersen, News24) He recounted to Allie that he saw a hand wielding a screwdriver come through the window, pointed straight at Cornelius' chest. The man's accomplices had forced their way into the car and frisked them, before three of the four drove off with him and Hannah, whom he had met three months prior. Parsons had promised to return Cornelius' blue Golf because they "just wanted to go home" - a lie which Marsh said Hannah appeared to believe. 'Everything will be okay' At the Helshoogte Pass, he was forced into the boot of the car. He was allowed out at an open field in Bernadino Heights in Kraaifontein, where Witbooi and Parsons tried to murder him. He was forced to lie on the ground before his attackers hurled bricks at his head until he lost consciousness. Marsh was left for dead, but woke up early that morning and went to look for help. He previously recounted his terror at seeing his attackers in the dock as they stared him down before he made his way onto the witness stand, but still managed to tearfully testify for three days.  Marsh told News24 that he finally met Cornelius' family during sentencing proceedings last week. He felt sympathy for them. Hannah's mother and grandmother also died less than a year after her murder. Her father, Willem, also shared some encouraging words with him, which he appreciated, Marsh said. "Hannah's father told me: ', 'Don't worry Cheslin. Everything will be okay. You will study next year again. This won't hold you back.'" 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
