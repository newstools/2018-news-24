According to Colonel Thembeka Mbele, he and his sister were on their way to Msilinga Primary School in Copesville. While walking, a man known to them as well as the man's friend who lives in the area, stopped to talk to him. "They instructed his sister to continue walking to school and that Andile will follow soon. A member of the community noticed what was going on and informed Andile's mother," said Mbele. Fihla's mother contacted the school only to find out that he did not arrive at school, according to Mbele. The matter was reported to police for investigation and they searched for Fihla on the day but he was nowhere to be found.
