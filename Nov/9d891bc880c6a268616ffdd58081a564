Staff at Mdzananda Animal Clinic in Makhaya, is reeling in shock after three armed robbers stormed the premises, robbing them of cash. The robbery comes as the clinic scrambles to raise funds after loosing one of its biggest funders recently. Marcelle du Plessis, fundraising and communications manager at the clinic, said the robbers entered the clinic as four staff members enjoyed their lunch. She said they ordered them to “keep quiet” and demanded cash. “Clearly they have been watching us,” she said. Du Plessis said the clinic does not normally keep cash on the premises and they were preparing to leave with some money when the trio pounced. “They also tried to take our computers, but we begged them to leave it because the entire information for the clinic is in there. We do not have ‘cloud’(an app) where we can store our information,” she said. After a brief engagement among the robbers, she said they decided to leave the computer. “They then locked us in the filing room and left,” she said. The workers were freed by one of their peers who arrived in the aftermath. Du Plessis said they immediately called the police. She said the incident has “shaken” everyone at the clinic, however there is no time to focus on what happened. “The animals and the community needs us, but you can see people are still struggling,” said Du Plessis. Mdzananda offers veterinarian services to thousands of pets in Khayelitsha and the surrounding areas for next to nothing. Du Plessis said while they remain committed to helping the community, it “makes you nervous for the future”. Police spokesperson Captain Siyabulela Vukubi said police were investigating.
