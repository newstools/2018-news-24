Maia spent ten days in Hong Kong, competing against schools from all around the world, in an experience she said was very educational and fun. In speaking of the competition, the young mathlete revealed that, at first, the thought of travelling worried her. “I didn’t want to go overseas without my family, but when I got back, I wanted to go back to Hong Kong because I had such great educational fun and experience. Also, I missed my friends.” In talking about what she found most interesting about mathematics, she said there is always something new that you can learn. Recently, the mathlete got awarded with an academic scholarship at Hillcrest High school for next year. “I was also selected to the Eskom National Science Expo and spent my October school holiday representing my province and school,” she shared. Not one to only focus on academic achievement, Maia also revealed that she is also involved in sport, saying; “In junior primary I was the athletics captain for my house, squad swimmer, and I’m currently the vice athletics captain for my team.”   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
