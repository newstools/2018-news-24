THE Margate community hall roof collapsed on Wednesday morning, allegedly due to strong winds. The hall roof’s structure is said to have been a concern for a long time. A resident who lives near the hall said the collapse was inevitable. “When the hall was first built there was a problem with it and could not be used for a while. It was repaired but started sagging again months ago. Then yesterday’s (Tuesday) wind damaged it more. The roof only collapsed this morning (Wednesday),” said the resident. Comment could not be retrieved from Ray Nkonyeni Municipality at the time of going to print.
