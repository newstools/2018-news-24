"If they do not appear, the court must report them to the law society and action must take place," Magistrate Delize Smith said. Present and co-accused Itumeleng Manama, 40, Bheki Biyela, 38, and Zakhele Zondi, 37 briefly appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. "Where is your attorney?" Smith asked Present, after noticing that the legal representatives were not there. "I don't know," he responded. The lawyers representing Manama, Biyela and Zondi were also absent and failed to inform the prosecutor or the court that they would not be available. The magistrate was unimpressed and the case was postponed to December 6.
