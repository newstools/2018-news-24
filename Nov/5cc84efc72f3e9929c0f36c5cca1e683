Abigail Nakedi, 39, was arrested last week Wednesday by the Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Unit and appeared in the Bethlehem Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges of fraud and corruption. The court official played along and alerted the Hawks. Nakedi was arrested after paying the alleged bribe. Upon her arrest, a vehicle, cellphones, a laptop and a date stamp that was allegedly used to stamp the release form were confiscated. The inmate is serving time for a cash-in-transit related offence. The matter was postponed to November 20 for a formal bail application while Nakedi remains in custody. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
