Sesona Ngqakamba Former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba has resigned as a member of Parliament, Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo has confirmed. He quit as a Cabinet minister on Tuesday. The tainted former home affairs minister issued a statement issued on Tuesday evening, speaking out on his resignation. "I did so after a long period of sustained and vitriolic public attacks on my integrity. I wish to state that my resignation is not an admission of guilt on my part," Gigaba said. He said that the integrity of government and the ANC was more important than him bearing political office.

National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete referred both the letter and the Public Protector's report to the Joint Committee on Ethics and Membersâ€™ Interests. These processes however look like they will now fall away in light of Gigaba's resignation as an MP. More to follow. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
