Pelane Phakgadi The police say they are continuing to make inroads into curbing cash-in-transit heists. This comes after a team comprising of Crime Intelligence from the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, in conjunction with the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) and the Tactical Response Team (TRT), arrested several suspects on Monday for allegedly planning to commit a CIT robbery, police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said on Tuesday. The operation began over the weekend after Crime Intelligence received a tip-off that a group of armed men from the Western Cape were planning to rob a CIT vehicle in Alice in the Eastern Cape, Naidoo said. The suspects were intercepted on Monday in Krwakrwa Village in Alice, and six people were arrested. Four were still on the run. The team also recovered two R4 rifles, four R5 rifles, a revolver, and vehicles which they believe were going to be used to carry out the robbery.

National police commissioner General Khehla Sitole commended the "continuous sterling work done by various multi-disciplinary teams dealing with cash-in-transit heists". "While we are making significant inroads into curbing cash-in-transit heists, more work needs to be done, as these robberies continue to plague us," he added.
