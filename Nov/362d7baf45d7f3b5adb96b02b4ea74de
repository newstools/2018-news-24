Dlamini said the same lengths the nation went to when it supported Bafana Bafana should apply when supporting Banyana Banyana. "Just as SAFA has previously arranged public viewing places for the men's national team, the same attitude should be extended to the women's national team. We will also be advocating for the increase in payment and sponsorships for the women's national team," Dlamini added. Banyana will be playing on Saturday against the Nigerian women's national team at 18:00 at the Accra Sports stadium in Ghana. The minister has also urged all South Africans to wear their national team colours on December 1 and to blow their vuvuzelas in support. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
