I have three small kids and have nowhere else to take them,” Nobuhle Sikhakhane said. She was part of dozens of Nkululeko resi­dents whose shacks were targeted by Msunduzi’s anti-land invasion unit. Nonkululeko Ndlela (39), who was at home with her unemployed husband when members of the unit pounced, said the Msunduzi security guards, who demolished half of her mud house, gave her two days to vacate the area. “I was shocked when this group of men arrived at my house and started stripping everything. They didn’t even bother to produce an eviction order — they just started demolishing,” she said. “As the community of Nkululeko we were scheduled to meet Msunduzi mayor Themba Njilo in the next few days so that the concerns of the residents and that of the municipality could be discussed. “However, we were shocked when the security guards started destroying our houses.” There are over 100 families living in the informal settlement, with some residents having been there since the early 1990s. “We expect the municipality to assist us by fixing the streets and delivering basic services such as running water and electricity, but what we get is the destruction of our houses by a government that is supposed to be looking after us,” said Thulani Ndlovu, a resident since 1996. Msunduzi Municipality could not be reached for comment.
