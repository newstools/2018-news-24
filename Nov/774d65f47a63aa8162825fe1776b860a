"This increase in movement of people and goods across borders is due to the inflow and outflow of travellers of various categories – tourists, cross-border workers, business, academic and educational activities," she said at a press briefing on Wednesday. "The movements we facilitate into and out of South Africa tend to peak during the festive season, school holidays and the Easter period." The team is also setting up overflow areas to process travellers in Maseru Bridge, Lebombo and Beitbridge to cater for the volumes expected. A team of IT support staff is expected to remain at high-volume ports of entry from December 5 to January 9 to provide on-site support. Operational hours are expected to be extended for busy ports of entry, covering pre-festive season movements, the festive season period and the reopening of schools. The Department of Home Affairs is also expected to deploy 425 additional staff at the busiest ports. "We implore all travellers leaving and entering South Africa to ensure that all their travel documents are in order to avoid unnecessary delays in ports. These include passports, visas, health certificates, permits for specified goods, plants and animals and vehicles insurance and bank authorised cross-border documents for vehicles." Chohan urged people to drive safely and wished everyone a safe and pleasant festive season.
