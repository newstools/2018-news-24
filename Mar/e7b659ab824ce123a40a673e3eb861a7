Dlamini was arrested for a number of charges, including violating a court order, public violence, assault, theft, and malicious damage to property. Dlamini was arrested in October 2016 and was released on R2 000 bail on November 9 in the High Court sitting in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court. READ: Fees Must Fall activist Mcebo Dlamini has eye on plea bargain His first bid for bail was unsuccessful. He was arrested after an incident at Wits, where he was photographed with the helmet and shield of a security guard. He was also charged with violating a court order after the university obtained an interdict against protesting students. Dlamini has been in and out of court and he appeared briefly in court in January. At the time, prosecutor Steven Rubin told the court the case was previously postponed because of the discovery of video footage. "We are ready for trial," he said at the time. However, Dlamini's lawyer Khathutshelo Nelson Mathibe, said he had approached the State because Dlamini wished to enter into a plea bargain.
