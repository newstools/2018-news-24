from the night Martin, Teresa and Rudi van Breda were axed to death in a brutal
attack in their Stellenbosch home. But the country might have to wait a while
longer to find out if the Van Breda’s youngest son, Henri (23), is guilty of
the crime. During the most recent court proceedings, Judge
Siraj Desai announced that he would deliver his verdict on 23 April. But a new report suggests that Judge
Desai had been removed from the case, “due to personal circumstances”. In the event that a new judge has to take over,
there’s a chance the case will need to be tried from the start. But Eric Ntabazalila, spokesperson for the
National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Western Cape, denies that Judge
Desai is being replaced. “It’s all a lie,” he told YOU magazine. “The case is being taken over by a different
judge, but it’s a temporary measure and only applies to tomorrow.” The NPA also stated that Henri would be in
court tomorrow for a possible postponement of his sentencing. During the 60-day trial, Henri pleaded not
guilty to axing his parents and brother to death and defeating the ends of
justice. He claims a balaclava-wearing intruder axed his
mother, brother and father to death in their home on De Zalze Estate in
Stellenbosch in January 2015. Henri is also facing a charge of attempted
murder for seriously injuring his younger sister, Marli, in the attack.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
