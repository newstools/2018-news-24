Police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said the blitz, which formed part of Operation Fiela, started on Wednesday when students alerted police to a suspicious-looking 32-year-old man in a residential area. He wasn't far from their high school. "Following a swift response, the police recovered a firearm and ammunition [and placed the man under] arrest," said Mavimbela. "Later [that] night, a 21-year-old duo [was] found in possession of a Toyota Hilux that [had been] hijacked from a police officer in Pretoria West about an hour earlier. He was not harmed." "The suspects were allegedly also found with an unlicensed handgun and ammunition." Mavimbela said that more than 2.5 million millilitres of alcohol had been seized at a local night club that had allegedly been operating without a licence. Elsewhere in Sunnyside, a 22-year-old student was allegedly caught in possession of a stolen laptop, Mavimbela added. "All the suspects who were arrested during the past 24 hours are expected to be charged for various offences," Mavimbela said. He said the action should serve as a warning to criminals. "The local police will work with other law enforcement agencies, [such as] the [Tshwane Metro Police Department], to ensure that not only are our people safe, but [they] feel safe during the long Easter weekend." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
