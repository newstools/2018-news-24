He told journalists that Kalfontein was one of the areas the DA was working hard to ensure it delivered services. "I came here today because the most under registered people are young people. We encourage them to register to vote because it is about their future." He added that come the 2019 elections, young people must ensure that they pick a government that ends poverty.

The IEC launched a number of initiatives to encourage South Africans to register following a 2016 Constitutional Court ruling which required the IEC to update the voters' roll with complete addresses. Why do you need to register? "The voters' roll is a fundamental safeguard for free and fair elections. It is an instrument for facilitating electoral participation, which is placed at the disposal of political parties for campaign purposes," said chief electoral officer Sy Mamabolo. "It serves a functional purpose as a planning tool for accurate provision of electoral material and the avoidance of electoral fraud." Jump to
