A Catholic in a majority Muslim nation, Kamara is known for his ready smile and dislike of confrontation, in sharp contrast to his opposition opponent Julius Maada Bio, a tough-talking former junta boss. Koroma has campaigned by Kamara's side, presenting him as the continuity candidate in the poor West African country that has suffered a civil war and an Ebola crisis. "I am (Koroma's) biggest legacy. I need to sustain what he has achieved... and build on it," Kamara said at one campaign rally.
