Cosas led a large group of high school pupils on a march to the provincial education department's offices on Friday, after they were informed that a number of schools in Khayelitsha did not have enough teachers for certain subjects, specifically mathematics. "We will close down KFC and McDonalds because it’s their friends' businesses," said Cosas chairperson Michael Mayalo during the protest outside the department's offices. "We can get enough attention and we will have enough learners. "We are calling on our parents to boycott work on Monday and assist us with the goal of obtaining quality education." The organisation also demanded that Education MEC Debbie Schafer be removed from office. "Cosas wants the MEC herself to come and listen to the students because it seems that the message is not getting to her," said Cosas political department head Mphumzi Giwu. Giwu said that the organisation had lost confidence in the MEC. "It is clear that the MEC cares less about black students in the Western Cape in the township schools. We want her out of office." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
