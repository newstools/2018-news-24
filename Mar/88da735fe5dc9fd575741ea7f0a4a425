Hlophe raped a 21-year-old high school pupil in the bushes near the Umsunduzi River, near Pietermaritzburg, while she was on her way to write her matric exams in October 2016, according to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Zwane. "He raped her at knife point and fled. A case of rape was opened at Umsunduzi police station and it was transferred to the Pinetown Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit for investigation," said Zwane. The accused was arrested in the Umsunduzi area and was subsequently linked to another case of rape that was reported in 2015. Zwane praised the "thorough investigation which led to the successful prosecution of Hlophe, and linking him to another case". Hlophe is still awaiting trial for the 2015 rape case, pending further investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
