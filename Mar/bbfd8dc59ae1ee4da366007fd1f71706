The decision to close Radio Miraya would be another blow for press freedom in South Sudan, where foreign correspondents have been forced to leave and authorities have targeted other media outlets. Radio Miraya was ordered to end its broadcast because of "persistent non-compliance and refusal to be regulated" under domestic laws, said Elijah Alier, who chairs South Sudan's media authority. Alier told reporters in Juba that the request to withdraw the frequency allocated to Radio Miraya would go into effect on Friday. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, however, said talks were ongoing with Juba about the decision. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent

At this point, the UN radio station is still broadcasting," said Dujarric. Run by the UN mission in South Sudan, Radio Miraya started broadcasting in 2006. It bills itself as an independent radio station that provides impartial news and information. South Sudan this year entered its fifth year of war, with nearly four million people uprooted and millions more in dire need of humanitarian aid. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
