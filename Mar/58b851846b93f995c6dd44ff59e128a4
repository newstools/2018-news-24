He was arrested in Roodepoort by the Hawks' South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (Saneb), said Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu. "The members were on the beat on an unrelated investigation when they observed a suspect hastily getting out of a vehicle that had just parked at the Florida Junction parking lot.  The same suspect got into a different vehicle and drove off," he said. He said this raised suspicion from the members. "They immediately pursued the said vehicle and intercepted it shortly afterwards. A search of the said vehicle resulted in the recovery of drugs believed to be heroin concealed inside boxes," he said. The suspect was then arrested immediately and both vehicles were impounded for further investigation, he said. "He is expected to appear at the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court on Friday," said Mulamu. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
