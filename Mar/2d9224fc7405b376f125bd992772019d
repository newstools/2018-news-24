video of hundreds of people looting a truck that turned over on the R59 north
of Vereeniging in Gauteng has emerged on Facebook. In
the video, posted on Intelligence Bureau SA’s  Facebook page, people from nearby informal settlements
can be seen taking boxes of a popular washing powder from the truck and walking
back to their homes. Some
of the looters are on top of the truck, trying to get in and take as many boxes
as they can. A
Meyerton Police Station spokesperson was unavailable for comment. Comments
on the incident were mixed – with some saying the looters were right, while others
were adamant a crime had been committed.  Watch the video here:   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
