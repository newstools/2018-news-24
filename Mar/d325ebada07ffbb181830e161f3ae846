The group, headed by the Conservative Party's Crispin Blunt, says in a statement on Tuesday it made the request in a letter to the Egyptian ambassador a day earlier. They said they want to visit Morsi in Egypt's Tora prison along with lawyers and a Labour parliamentarian who is a doctor specialised in cases of mistreatment and torture. In a copy of the letter, Blunt says he was invited on behalf of Morsi's family, which says they have seen him only twice in detention in four years and that he is suffering from diabetes, loss of sight and other ailments not receiving proper treatment.
