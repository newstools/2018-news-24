Residents had initially called police a few days after a 49-year-old woman and her 19-year-old son disappeared following a disagreement with family members on January 9. When officers arrived at a relative's house on January 13, they spotted a fresh grave and became suspicious. Officers and residents dug up the grave and found the bodies of the woman and her son. "The body of a woman was chopped into pieces and wrapped in plastic," said police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. Cases of murder were opened. Following up on information, they traced the man to Gebhasi Farm in Eshowe, where he had been hiding, said Zwane. "A team of detective members from Nyoni police made a breakthrough when they arrested the 45-year-old suspect at Eshowe area yesterday," said Zwane. The man will appear in the Nyoni Magistrate's Court on Friday on two counts of murder. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa strongly condemned the killings. "Our detectives will work around the clock in making sure that the suspect allegedly involved in this brutal killing is brought to book and faces the full might of the law," said Langa. "We also appeal to people to resolve their differences peacefully rather than involve themselves in fighting which leads to killings," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
