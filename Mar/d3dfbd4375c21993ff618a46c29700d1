Writing on his Twitter page this week, Johnson said that he was delighted to welcome Zimbabwe's finance minister Patrick Chinamasa in London. See his tweet below. Chinamasa was in London, leading a Zimbabwean delegation for engagement under Mnangagwa’s new theme: "Zimbabwe is open for business." Following Johnson's tweet, opposition leader David Coltart challenged the UK minister to also listen to the voices of the people on the ground, according to a Daily News report. Coltart said that the condition for a fair vote were not yet met and the country's constitution was "flagrantly violated". There were indications the two countries would soon mend their ties following recent intervention by Queen Elizabeth II.
