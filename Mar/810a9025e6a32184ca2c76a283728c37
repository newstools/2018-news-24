On Friday, he went above and beyond the call of duty, saving a small injured bird during the incessant rains. Lamola, who is stationed at the Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria, found the bird lying in a puddle near the building on Friday morning. He took the bird inside, dried it off with a towel, and gave it water and food. The bird proceeded to perch on his shoulder as he went about his morning duties. Lamola said he would release the bird once it had got its strength back. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
