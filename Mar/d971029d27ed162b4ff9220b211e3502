'Turned the city around'Maimane said voters had rejected the ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay because the city had been so stripped through corruption and maladministration that it could barely deliver any basic services.“In 18 months, the DA-led coalition in NMB has turned the city around. We have made progress in basic service delivery, in righting the finances of the Metro, and in delivering a Metro Police department to fight crime,” he said.He said this progress would be halted if the EFF returned the Metro to the ANC.“We will mobilise public support to Save Nelson Mandela Bay, and have launched a petition for the public to sign. We encourage all public to sign our petition here.”“We also encourage the public to contact EFF councillors in Nelson Mandela Bay and make it clear to them that voters rejected the corrupt ANC in NMB, and don’t want them back,” he said.“The EFF must know that voters, even their own voters, will punish them severely for returning the Metro to the corrupt ANC, just as it is slowly emerging from the legacy of twenty years of corruption.”  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
