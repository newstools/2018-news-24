Nairobi's police chief Joseph ole Tito said on Sunday the operation had been completed in the debris of the four-story guest house that collapsed Saturday morning in Ruai area on the outskirts of the capital. Joseph Gichangi, the area police chief, says receipts showed two couples checking into the guest house but leaving before the collapse.
