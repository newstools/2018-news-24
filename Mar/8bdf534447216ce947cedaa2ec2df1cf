The individuals, who called themselves Stephen and Sherinne, claim they are working for the CSIR recruitment office, said spokesperson David Mandaha. "According to the information we have, Stephen finds young, job-seeking ladies on social media platforms. Then Sherinne contacts them for a 'telephonic interview', using a private number," he said. "After the interview, Stephen asks to meet with the 'candidate' at a certain location, where he demands sex in order to secure the 'job'." The CSIR was aware of one university student who had come forward after being scammed.

He said meetings or interviews for real CSIR jobs only took place at their offices. The CSIR only advertised its jobs in mainstream newspapers, on its official social media platforms, and on its website, www.csir.co.za. Mandaha encouraged any victims to come forward and report the scam to their nearest police station.
