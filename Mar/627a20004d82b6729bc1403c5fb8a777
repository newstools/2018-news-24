About a dozen workers from the campaign of Moussa Mustafa Moussa carried posters of him about 100m in downtown Cairo on Sunday, stopping well short of the end of their planned march. At least twice as many photographers and cameramen from state and private media documented the march. Sisi is virtually certain to win re-election in the March 26-28 vote, after a string of would-be contenders withdrew under pressure or were arrested. Moussa, the only other candidate on the ballot, is a little-known politician who supports el-Sissi. He did not attend the march and has largely avoided the media. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
