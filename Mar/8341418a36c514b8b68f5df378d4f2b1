The fourth person was identified by the Ugu District Municipality as Sipho Khuzwayo, who worked at the municipality for many years as the senior manager of Economic Development and Environmental Services. Lieutenant Colonel Zandra Wiid said the accident happened at about 9 pm and when police and emergency services arrived at the scene, they found a sedan and a bakkie had collided and caught alight. She said it was established that three occupants were in the bakkies and one person was in the sedan. They all died at the scene. “The remains were moved to the Port Shepstone mortuary and DNA samples were taken,” Wiid said. She said a culpable homicide docket was opened. Ugu District Municipality released a statement on Khuzwayo’s death on Wednesday morning. In the statement, municipal spokesperson France Zama said the municipality was in shock.

Lower South Coast regional secretary Mzwandile Mkhwanazi said the ANC went through the veins of Khuzwayo. “Comrade Khuzwayo was a true cadre, he never feared to voice his views. He was an agent of development and was more into policy development as he understood it better, whether it was in the community or in the movement. We have lost a cadre who was becoming a true revolutionist. “The ANC offers its condolences to family, friends and colleagues. May his soul rest in peace,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
