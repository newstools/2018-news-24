Zimkhitha Tetyana, 45, with the help of two accomplices, Lwando Ramba and Yandisa Tonci, murdered 52-year-old Mlamli Tetyana in Dutywa on June 2, 2016. "Both Lwando Ramba and Yandisa Tonci were hired by Zimkhitha Tetyana to murder her husband," said police spokesperson Captain Jackson Manatha. "There was a misunderstanding between the wife and the deceased which led to the wife [hiring] the two accused." Zimkhitha and her accomplices were arrested a couple of days after the murder. The three accused were charged and convicted for conspiracy to commit murder. Eastern Cape police commissioner Lieutenant General Liziwe Ntshinga welcomed the sentences imposed on the trio. She praised Dutywa police detectives for their swift action which led to the arrest of the accused. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
