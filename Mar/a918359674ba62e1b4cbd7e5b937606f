Hildegard Steenkamp was accused of defrauding her former employer of R460 million during her 13 years at the company. It is alleged that she duplicated payments and transferred money into her late husband's bank account. She was arrested last year, after a three-month investigation, and was released on R250 000 bail, with conditions, in December. In court on Wednesday, her case was postponed for further investigation. Hawks spokesperson Captain Carol Mulamu said the woman will have to continue complying with her bail conditions. "She had to hand in her passport and she is not allowed to apply for any travel documents during this time." "She must also report to the Boksburg police station three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays, and inform the investigating officers whenever she wants to leave the province." The case was postponed to May 31. The Hawks previously attached 11 luxury cars and motorbikes and seven immovable properties, with furniture and appliances, after her arrest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
