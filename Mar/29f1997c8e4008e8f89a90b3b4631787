	        Send us your pictures   ·  Send us your stories Dr. Seuss, The Cat in the Hat, Mother Goose ... these are but a few of the many classic children’s literature with which the current generation are not familiar. Therefore Despatch Preparatory has decided to grant their learners the opportunity once a week to visit the Despatch Library. “We realized that learners don’t know stories, not to mention that they have no clue about the classic children’s stories. Reading is such an essential part in developing a child’s cognitive skills, imagination and creativity,” said Adele de Lange, Head of Department at Despatch Preparatory. The library visits to grant children access to all varieties of literature was one of De Lange’s brainstorming ideas. “It is amazing to observe their reaction when they find a book that they are interested in. Many of the learners know what a library is, but have never been inside a library. That is why it is so heart-warming to see how they get carried away whilst reading a book they like.” Apart from providing the learners the opportunity to respond to literature, they are also taught the basics of library etiquette. How to handle a book, how to page and how to place it back where it belongs. Learners have to hand in the books after three weeks and then also have to give a brief feedback about the book. “We started with the project only this year and it is for the four Grade 3 classes only. We wish to expand it, but transport is limited.” According to librarian Tokozile Calata, “It is wonderful to see how eager the learners are when they visit the library. “Now that they know what there is to offer inside the library, it is like a new world opening up to them.” “I find it very interesting that so many of the young learners ask for books about cooking. I think one day we will have a lot of good cooks,” said Calata. During public holidays various educational programmes are held at the Despatch Library. Librarian said she wish more kids will join  in the fun. Transport, however, is a problem  for some of the learners, especially those from Khayamnandi. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
