Inuwa Garba tells The Associated Press that friends of his daughter who were freed on Wednesday told him the 16-year-old died from injuries in the stampede during the mass abduction a month ago. "They told me five of the girls died and my daughter, who was among them, was the first to die," Garba says. The survivors told him the bodies were buried in the bush. Nigeria's government has not commented on the fate of the six missing girls. At least one of the freed girls has said a Christian classmate remained captive, while those released are Muslim.
