taking aim at himself. He is currently in a critical condition in the hospital,
The
Real Deal adds. A police officer told People, Crane hasn’t yet been charged with Parisa’s murder
as authorities are first waiting to see if he’ll survive his injuries. In the meantime, the couple’s two kids – who were unharmed
in the attack – are staying with family. According to The
Real Deal, Crane works as a realtor at Pacific Rim, but on his professional
bio, Crane claims to have worked as a child actor with Disney and Warner
Brothers. But a source with knowledge of Disney told People:
“There is no record of Kevin Crane starring in a Disney Channel series or
movie.” The publication also tried contacted Warner Bros but they
couldn’t be reached for comment. “She possessed an unimaginable amount of strength,” a friend
of Parisa told People.
“Her kids were her number one priority. She was their whole world, and they
were hers. “I can sincerely say she was a loyal friend, a strong woman,
and an absolute joy to be around. She was incredibly compassionate towards
friends, and always put everyone else first. I’ll miss her terribly.” Sources: The Real Deal, People, Extra TV 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
