burnt-out vehicle at Diep River railway station in Cape Town is that of missing
Constantia resident Gill Packham. Police said in a statement that the body was positively
identified by use of DNA comparison. A 57-year-old man from Constantia, was arrested for Gill’s
murder. The arrest took place late Thursday night. The suspect, who
cannot be named at this stage, will appear at the Wynberg Regional Court on Monday
where he’s expected to apply for bail. Gill’s family have requested that their privacy be respected
and a statement will be made by a family spokesperson in due course. Last week, a friend of the family told YOU the Packhams were
very upset and keeping to themselves. “They are all tight-lipped and do not want to say
anything. I haven’t even seen them since it all happened.” One of Gill’s daughters, Nicola, has also since removed
the heartbreaking
Facebook post in which she pleads with people to help look for her
“precious mom”. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
