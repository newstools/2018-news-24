The Nelson Mandela Foundation has hailed the prison sentence handed down to former real estate agent Vicky Momberg as "a clear message that the kind of race-based abuse [which she] was found guilty of will not be tolerated". "For too long, post-apartheid South Africa has pursued what we would call strategies of generosity in relation to such manifestations of racism. It must stop. "But it is not enough to act against 'incidents' of racism. It is time to transform the underlying structures of power and privilege," it said. Momberg was convicted on Wednesday in the Randburg Magistrate's Court for her racist tirade against a black police officer who had come to her aid in 2016. The officer had attempted to assist her after a smash-and-grab incident in Northriding, Johannesburg. Momberg lashed out at him, using the k-word almost 50 times. She was found guilty of four counts of crimen injuria on November 3 and sentenced to an effective two years in prison.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
