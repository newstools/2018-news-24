KOUGA Municipality would like to remind businesses and consumers that four brands of chilled foods have been recalled due to the recent Listeriosis outbreak. The four brands are Enterprise, Mieliekip, Bokkie and Renown while the chilled foods that have been recalled include polony, smoked russians, frankfurters, pork bangers, viennas and spreads. Community Services Portfolio Councillor Daniel Benson said that while some shops had also recalled other products they stock, the municipality was still awaiting official instruction from the National Consumers Commission regarding these. He said the municipal Environmental Health Practitioners had been monitoring the recall since the products were pulled from the market three weeks ago. “The municipality is also helping to ensure that the recalled products are safely disposed of, at the cost of the producers or distributors.” He said businesses and consumers were advised to take the following steps by 31 March 2018 so as to receive a full refund: “For your safety, we also want to recommend that you clean your fridge with a disinfectant and wipe down any product that came into contact with the recalled product.” He further asked residents to keep an eye open for shops that have not yet removed the products from their shelves. “Please notify our Environmental Health section on 042 200 2200 so that they can ensure the food is removed. They can also be contacted for clarity and further information.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
