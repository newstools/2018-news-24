KZN Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said a multi-disciplinary team arrested the two men, aged 25 and 39, for the murder of Mhlanzi, who was stationed at the KwaMaphumulo police station. According to KZN police, Mhlanzi was killed when a group of men entered a shop in KwaMaphumulo and robbed employees of cash on February 23.

On March 7, a shootout ensued during a joint operation at a hostel in KwaMashu in the northern part of Durban, which led to three suspects being killed and two suspects being arrested. KZN acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended police for the arrests and said he hoped that the police's actions would bring some closure to Mhlanzi's family. "We are told that these men may be linked to many robberies that were committed in KwaZulu-Natal." "We once again wish to remind criminals not to even think of shooting at our police officers as they will be making a mistake," said Langa. He urged communities to distance themselves from criminals in their neighbourhoods.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
