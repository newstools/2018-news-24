perhaps she shouldn’t have started so soon…. A US woman was arrested for driving under the
influence en route to her wedding. According to People,
Amber Young (32), from Arizona, was arrested after officers were called out to
a three-car pileup Marana, a small town in the south-western US state. One person sustained minor injuries in the
accident and taken to hospital. People reports that Young had only a short
stint behind bars with KVOA.com
confirming that she was released when her fiancé arrived and a criminal
citation was signed. According to Fox
News, an officer at the scene, Sergeant
Chriswell Scott tweeted a photo of the bride being handcuffed in all her
wedding finery. "Don't drive impaired, till death do we
part doesn't need any help." The tweet has since been deleted. It’s unclear whether the wedding went ahead. Sources: Fox
