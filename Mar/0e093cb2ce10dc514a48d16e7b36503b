Zwane said a structure at the toll plaza was also burnt, which resulted in a case of malicious damage to property being opened at the KwaDukuza police station. "The protesters were apparently demanding [an] increase in salaries. SAPS KwaDukuza managed to disperse the unruly mob. [There were] no arrests or injuries. A case of public violence is being investigated by KwaDukuza SAPS."
