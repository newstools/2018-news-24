The suspects, including nine leaner licence applicants, a clerk and a cleaner, were nabbed on Tuesday in a joint operation by the RTMC's national anti-corruption unit, the Hawks and the KwaZulu-Natal traffic and transport inspectorate unit, RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said in a statement. "The arrests followed a year-long investigation in which officials from the Howick driver learner testing centre were observed engaging in unethical and corrupt conduct at the centre," he said. Investigations are continuing and more arrests are expected, he said. "Another official was not found and law enforcement officials have a warrant for his immediate arrest," said Zwane. He said corruption related to the illegal issuing of driving licence documents was a major concern and "is believed to contribute significantly to road accidents in South Africa". "About 80% of fatal crashes are attributed to human error and the ability of the drivers to handle the vehicle plays an important role in this," he said. The suspects are expected to appear in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday, he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
