Kheswa was convicted on four counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and 12 counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, according to police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane. The accused first caught the attention of authorities at the end of 2017 when he shot Makhosazane Mary Jane Mokoena, 34, in Scottburgh, and Siyabonga Ngcobo, 23, a mere 15 minutes later. "He was arrested on 22 November 2017 after the Task Team from SAPS Ugu Cluster Operational Command Centre worked tirelessly to apprehend him," said Zwane. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major General Bheki Langa commended the team of detectives who investigated the case. "The detectives worked diligently, for long hours, often through the night, to thoroughly investigate all the crimes committed by the accused," he said. "I welcome the sentences and I am sure that the communities feel much safer now, knowing that this ruthless criminal has been removed from the streets to spend the rest of his life in prison. "The families of those who were robbed of their lives by Kheswa will now have a sense of closure." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
