In a statement, Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said an intelligence-led operation by provincial police and Limpopo tracking teams on Thursday resulted in the arrest of the men, aged between 31 and 39. "The [men] apparently became suspicious and immediately abandoned their planned heist, then fled from the scene. However, police cornered them at the Lydenburg-Ohrigstad-Burgersfort crossing. "Some of the [men] abandoned their vehicles - a silver Mercedes Benz and a silver Volkswagen Polo - and tried to run away on foot, but were no match for the men in blue, who managed to catch all of them." The Mercedes was found to have earlier been stolen at Mhala while the Polo ostensibly belonged to one of the men, Bhembe said. "The [men] were found in possession of four firearms including an R4 rifle, as well as three pistols. The [men] are facing charges of conspiracy to commit a crime, illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, as well as possession of a stolen motor vehicle." The possibility that they were involved in other heists across the province was also being probed, Bhembe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
