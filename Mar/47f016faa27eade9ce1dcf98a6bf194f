When they arrived, the fire had already destroyed furniture. The cause of the fire is not yet known and is being investigated. The home owners, James Jali and his wife Noluvo, were not there when the fire started. “At 6 am, I left my two children inside the house to go to work. When I returned at 9 am for tea, I saw a cloud of smoke and when I get closer I discovered that the smoke was coming from my house,” said Noluvo. She said furniture, blankets and her 12-year-old daughter’s school uniform were destroyed. “I am glad that the identity documents and birth certificates for my children were not damaged,” said Noluvo. Jali said the total cost of the damaged items is estimated at R20 000. He appealed to good Samaritans to help with a new uniform for his daughter. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
