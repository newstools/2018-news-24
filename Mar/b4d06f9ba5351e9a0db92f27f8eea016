Faisal Ahbale said Friday's attack took place at the town's southern entrance. No group immediately claimed responsibility but Ahbale said he believes it was carried out by the extremist Islamic State group. Ajdabiya is situated west of Benghazi and has been under the control of the Libyan National Army in the country's east since 2016 after forcing out Islamic militants. The LNA is led by Libya's strongman Khalifa Hifter. Libya descended into chaos with its 2011 civil war, which toppled and later killed longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi. The country is currently split between governments in the east and the west. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
