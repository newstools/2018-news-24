Harare's Budiriro suburb, and national parks officials are warning people not
to cross rivers as the reptiles have become more active and are showing up in
unexpected places, the state-owned Herald newspaper has said. Tsitsi Jambaya was killed by the crocodile on Wednesday
morning as she tried to cross a river in Budiriro, south-western Harare, to
fetch firewood, a Zimbabwe state parks authority spokesperson Tinashe Farawo was quoted as saying. "She was accompanied by her neighbour, who later notified
residents and the next of kin about the incident," Farawo said. Crocodile attacks in Harare are rare but after recent heavy
rains tributaries to the nearby Lake Chivero are reported to be in full flow,
allowing crocodiles to move into areas where they are not usually seen. Farawo said parks rangers had been deployed to hunt down the
crocodile that killed Jambaya. Several attacks reported "We have been receiving several reports on crocodile attacks
therefore we urge all the people in communities, especially where there are
water bodies, to desist from crossing rivers," he added. The tragedy in Budiriro came in the same week as residents
in the western coal-mining town of Hwange found an angry three metre-long
crocodile outside the main entrance of the town’s hospital. The crocodile was charging at residents and parks rangers
eventually had to shoot it. The appearance of the crocodile in the middle of
the town took many by surprise as the hospital is 10km away from the
nearest dam. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
