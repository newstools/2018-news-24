Quintin Jettoo, the team’s operations manager, said: “It’s correct to say Ntshangase was struck by lightning. But we don’t have the doctor’s report on the extent of his injuries.” Jettoo said Ntshangase was the only player struck. KickOff.com reported that the team from KwaZulu-Natal Midlands was playing against an amateur side yesterday when lightning struck and 21-year-old Ntshangase was rushed to hospital for further observation. One club official, who wants to remain anonymous, told Kick Off: “The club played a friendly match today [1 March] and Ntshangase was struck by lightning and has been taken to the mediclinic in Pietermaritzburg and only his parents are allowed to see him.” The centre forward, who has played two games as a substitute so far this season, was promoted last season along with Bandile Shandu and Siphesihle Ndlovu. The youngster is tipped to be one of the future stars of Maritzburg United. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
