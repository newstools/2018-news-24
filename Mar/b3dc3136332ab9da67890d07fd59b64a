The alleged rape occurred two weeks ago, Chief Superintendent Wilfred Kgasago said. "After raping the victim, the man apparently heated a tablespoon and burnt his victim's private parts." The man was arrested on Tuesday in Tsenolong Section, Tembisa, after an informant contacted members of the EMPD's community liaison unit to say that the alleged rapist had been spotted. He is expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrate's Court on charges of rape and assault with the intent to do grievous bodily harm. Meanwhile, the 33-year-old complainant has been discharged from hospital and is recovering at home. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
