READ: NPA to prosecute former president Jacob Zuma The 16 charges of corruption, money laundering, fraud and racketeering stem from a bribe he allegedly received from French arms company Thales to influence the awarding of contracts in South Africa's multi-billion-rand arms deal. In 1997, Thales won a R2.6bn stake to supply combat systems for four frigates procured by the navy as part of South Africa's R60bn arms acquisition programme. The charges announced on Friday relate to 783 questionable payments Zuma allegedly received.
