Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said the recent outbreak of the deadly Listeria bacteria had been traced to Enterprise's Polokwane facility, which manufactures products such as polony.

"We cannot afford to lose any life; this is a generation that has liberated our land, it must live long enough to see its true benefits." READ: Enterprise Foods to recall affected products, but conducting own listeriosis tests Ndlozi said the "blame must be placed squarely" at the feet of Enterprise Food and Rainbow Chicken after Motsoaledi said the outbreak had been narrowed down to those facilities. "They must be held accountable for spreading disease and killing people," Ndlozi said. The South African outbreak of listeriosis has claimed 180 lives and was successfully traced after several children presented with gastroenteritis.
