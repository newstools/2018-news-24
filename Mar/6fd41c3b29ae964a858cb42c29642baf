rocked by severe turbulence, creating scenes of panic among passengers who
thought the plane was about to break up mid-air, a newspaper said Thursday. Flight UM438 flew into turbulence around an hour after
take-off on Tuesday, said the private NewsDay. 'It could have been the end' "The plane shook like it was about to break up into two.
People were crying and praying everywhere in the plane, it was a frightening
moment that I will never forget," an unnamed passenger told the paper. The passenger paid tribute to the plane's captain who
managed to keep the aircraft under control. "It could have been the end of me
and my family," the passenger said. Ageing fleet There were no reports of injuries and the plane landed
safely in Dar-es-Salaam. The flight had already been delayed by an hour due to "technical issues", NewsDay said. Air Zimbabwe runs a tiny fleet of ageing aircraft: two
Boeings, an Airbus and one propeller plane. The company has been severely
mismanaged and is currently struggling under a debt of around $300 million. In a report to parliament this week Transport
Minister Joram Gumbo said Air Zimbabwe would in the next few weeks "take
delivery of new equipment which will greatly improve its operations". KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
