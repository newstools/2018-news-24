Twenty-year-old Anthony Gelia also was found guilty on Monday of first-degree home invasion and a felony firearms charge stemming from the November 2016 killing of 26-year-old Brittany Southwell. Jurors appeared shaken on Friday while they watched a Facebook Live recording recovered from Gelia's cellphone showing him kick in a door and open fire. A medical examiner said Southwell died from a bullet that entered her side and punctured her lungs. The Jackson Citizen Patriot reports Gelia is scheduled to be sentenced May 9. A felony murder conviction in Michigan carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news
