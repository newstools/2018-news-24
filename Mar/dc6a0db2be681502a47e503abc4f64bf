Nqobile Zondi on Wednesday received life imprisonment plus 10 years for housebreaking. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said that in September 2016, an 11-year-old girl was at her home in Imbali township helping at her mother's tuck shop when Zondi asked to buy a cigarette. "The victim went to her mother's room to fetch the cigarette, the accused followed her in the passage and grabbed her, [pulled her into] the room and raped her," Zwane said. He said a case of rape was opened at Plessislaer police station where "swift action by the investigators" led to the immediate arrest of Zondi. "The accused made several court appearances until his conviction and sentencing." KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa welcomed the sentence. "Violent men are not allowed to stay in our society, we will make sure that all those involved in crimes against women and children are sent to prison indefinitely," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
