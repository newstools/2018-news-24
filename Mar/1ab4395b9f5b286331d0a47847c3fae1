In the video, which was posted by Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness (CICA) on Friday morning, two men can be seen carrying a large plasma TV and attempting to put it into the back seat of a silver Audi parked in the house’s driveway. The pair can be seen struggling to fit the huge TV into the car but after a while they eventually put it in through the boot. The two men then jump and speed off. According to CICA’s post, a domestic worker was assaulted by the alleged robbers during the incident. Although the registration of the getaway car has been shared on social media, the Randfontein Police Station was unavailable to confirm whether any arrests have been made.
