According to ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring, paramedics, along with provincial fire and other services, arrived in the early hours of the morning to find the man lying trapped chest-deep inside a grain silo. "Several men had climbed inside the silo and had begun to remove the large amount of grain," said Meiring. "Provincal services utilised various rescue and cutting equipment to cut a large hole in the bottom of the silo, allowing more access for grain to be removed."
