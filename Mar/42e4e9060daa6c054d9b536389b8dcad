decades in power because he "listened to the people" who wanted him to carry on
ruling Zimbabwe. "I always listened to the people. The people still wanted
me," Mugabe told the Zimbabwe Independent in an interview at his Blue Roof
Mansion in Harare. Mugabe stepped down last November after the army took
control of the country and just as parliament began the process to impeach him. Incredulous Zimbabweans took to social media on Friday to criticise
Mugabe over his claim that people still wanted him as president. Wrote
@CountEvans: "This old man dreams a lot. People from where? Stealing elections
and victimising people are not actions of someone who is liked by the people." Added @Breezy_Geek1: "So why didn't he listen to the people
who marched demanding him to step down." Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Harare on
November 18 in support of the military action, but Mugabe has since said the
demonstrators were just supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change. Mugabe told the Independent the fact that he had outlived
contemporaries like former vice presidents Joseph Msika and Simon Muzenda had
influenced his decision to stay on in power. He said he told himself: "If I go,
who would keep the party intact?" 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
