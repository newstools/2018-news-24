The 54-year-old Plumstead man was apprehended earlier this week. City of Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said on Friday that officers attached to the Neighbourhood Safety Team Unit arrested the man, who allegedly groomed the teen on social media. "He posed as a much younger person and convinced her to post topless pictures of herself to him.  He then set up a meeting with her in the Retreat station area," Dyason said. "When she arrived and discovered his age and that he had deceived her, she wanted to leave, but he threatened to expose the pictures on social media and shame her. He then forced himself on her." Dyason said the man then promised to delete the photos and the teen left for home. "He called her again and made the same threats if she did not meet him at the same place. She alerted the law enforcement members who, prior to the meeting, hid in the surrounding bush and waited for the suspect to arrive. "When he arrived and the victim identified him, he was arrested by the officers." Police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the man will appear in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court once charged. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
