She lamented the interference at these sites which were involved in “crucial work”, explaining that delays of “weeks at a time” were caused by such thefts. “Furthermore, theft of other City infrastructure often results in water running to waste,” she added. “It is not possible to reliably say how much water has been lost, but in this time of scarcity any water lost due to theft and vandalism is too much,” said Limberg. Tools, batteries, vehicles and any materials which could be perceived to have scrap value are being targeted. Since July 2017 more than R5m worth of hydrants, meters and valves have been stolen or damaged, she said. An appeal was made for anyone with information about these crimes to report it.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
