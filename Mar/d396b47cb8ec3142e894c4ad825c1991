reportedly found himself at the centre of controversy after he suggested that men
should "beat" their wives as a form of punishment within a marriage. The MP, Onesimus Twinamasiko, appeared on NTV Uganda saying: "As a man, you need to discipline your wife. You need to touch
her a bit, tackle her and beat her to streamline her". Twinamasiko said this following
comments by President Yoweri Museveni that men who beat women were cowards and
should face the full wrath of the law. Watch the video posted to Twitter below as Twinamasiko speaks More than one in five women aged 15-49 experience domestic or sexual violence in Uganda, according to a government report published in 2017, said a New Zimbabwe.com report. Social media users reacted angrily to Twinamasiko's remarks, with some
saying that he must aplogise to victims of domestic violence. See Twitter reaction below But, according to a BBC report, Twinamasiko
defended his comments, saying that "his wife had even doled out a slap in his
direction on one occasion". "I don't mean beatings which cause
injuries or death - but a slap - I would feel fine! Because it's calling me to
order. We would sit down and sort it out. "I was slapped once by
my wife and it was OK with me, because we sorted out our differences. I also
slapped her once. She had wronged me," Twinamasiko was quoted as saying. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
