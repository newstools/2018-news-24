Regional Co-ordinator Mohamud Saleh said on Friday the attackers targeted government administration offices and Kenya police camps. He said the militants blew up a telecommunications mast to cut off cell phone contact before the attack.

Kenyan security has managed to restrict a wave of al Shabaab attacks to border areas with Somalia in recent years. Police said they prevented a major attack by the militants in Nairobi last week.
