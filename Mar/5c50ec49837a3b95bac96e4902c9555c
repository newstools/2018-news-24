This hotspot in Tokyo Sexwale, Jeffreys Bay, is changing the face of our heterogenous community’s food experience. Chef/owner Dallas Land chatted to the Kouga Express on his revolutionary soul food which he prepares on an open fire right where the patrons are seated. We are in the midst of the people, in the heartbeat of the community - surrounded by colour, movement, livestock, little children popping in for a quick hello. The integration is complete: A neighbour lady sells Dallas spinach, while Awethu buys butternut and beetroot from the Jeffreys Bay Comprehensive High School, street vendors and meat from local shops. With these Dallas conjures up tantalising dishes on wooden boards or in pans with flavoursome vegetables, samp, mash, rice or pap. Then there is the introduction of ‘special’ nights such as one evening this past week where all the attendants ordered the R55 steak with pap and veg despite the availability of the entire Awethu menu. So sit back, sip a Township Ice Tea with the head-butt of a local goat, and feast on the abundance of goodness. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
