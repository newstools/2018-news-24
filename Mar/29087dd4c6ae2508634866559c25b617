work following a court order, the Gauteng department of health said on Sunday. Forensic pathology workers embarked on an unprotected strike
on March 7, demanding formal training from the Department of Health. Bodies piled up at government mortuaries across Gauteng as
staff downed tools. Acting chief executive of the Forensic Medical Services, Dr
Medupe Modisane, previously told News24 that workers wanted a formal
qualification, which could impact on their remuneration. READ: Bodies piling up at Gauteng mortuaries as staff down tools The Germiston mortuary was the worst affected by the
unprotected strike. On Thursday, the health department applied for a court
interdict against the striking workers. The Braamfontein Labour Court ruled on Friday that all
workers should return to work with immediate effect. Gauteng health department spokesperson Lesemang Matuka said
this would enable families to bury their loved ones. "The department regrets inconveniences to families as a
result of the disruptions to services. The principle of 'no work, no pay' will
be implemented to all employees who embarked on unprotected industrial action
across the board." Matuka said the Health Professions Council had finalised the
requirements for a formal training course.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
