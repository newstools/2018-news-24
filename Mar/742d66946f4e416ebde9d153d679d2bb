The first shooting took place at Mphalwini in Ekombe at about 21:30, said Captain Nqobile Gwala. Two unknown gunmen entered the house and opened fire on the family, she said. "Four victims aged between 18 and 76 sustained gunshot wounds to the upper body and died on the scene. One of the victims is a traditional healer and the other is a traditional healer trainee," said Gwala. She said another victim believed to be in his thirties sustained gunshot wounds and was taken to hospital. "Two children aged 13 and 16 managed to escape unharmed and sought help from the neighbours." The second incident took place 30 minutes later at Ezimbidla in Ekombe. Community urged to come forward "Neighbours heard gunshots at 22:00. When they checked in the morning, they found that their neighbour, who is also a traditional healer, had been shot dead," she said. Gwala said the neighbours found the 70-year-old man's body in a bush a few metres away from his house. "He sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the upper body. He was living alone in his house," she said. The motive for the attacks was unknown at this stage. "The investigation will determine whether the two incidents are linked or not," added Gwala. KwaZulu-Natal acting police commissioner Major General Bheki Langa condemned the shootings. "I have instructed a task team to investigate the murders. We are also appealing to community members to come forward with information that will lead to the arrest of the suspects," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
