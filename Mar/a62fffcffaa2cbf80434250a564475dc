Caroline Smith, 55, from Eersterust in Pretoria claims that she has been waiting for her son Akeano Smith's unabridged certificate since she first applied for it in April 2017. Smith told News24 that she applied for the certificate on behalf of Akeano, 17, at home affairs in Schubart Street in Pretoria. Akeano, who matriculated from Prosperitus Secondary School in Eersterust last year, won a scholarship at a Norway university. "The Norway Embassy are awaiting his certificate to finalise his acceptance at a university in Norway to study there," his mother said. 'His life became stagnant' Smith, who works at Unisa, said her son had been "affected tremendously", as all his friends had started life after school. "His life became stagnant due to the inability to travel abroad for study purposes," she said. He is interested in Life Sciences, she added. The worried mother said the only thing they had received so far was a tracking number from home affairs. They received it in January, she said. Department of Home Affairs spokesperson Thabo Mokgola said the matter had been referred to a relevant unit "for a speedy resolution". "Our officials will contact the client with a view to attain further information and assist," Mokgola said.
