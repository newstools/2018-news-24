Solontsi, who was on trial for 39 charges of rape and several of housebreaking with intention to rape, and robbery, was described as South Africa's "worst serial rapist" by police spokesperson Captain Mali Govender. The convicted criminal pleaded guilty to the rape of women and girls typically between the ages of 11 and 46. "The judge initially wanted to give him 12 life sentences, which add up to 706 years imprisonment, but because he is a dangerous criminal he changed his mind to an indefinite sentence," said Govender. National Prosecuting Authority regional spokesperson Tsepo Ndwalaza said that Solontsi's two previous rape convictions also played a role in the sentencing. Solontsi will appear in court in 25 years for a review of the sentence. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
