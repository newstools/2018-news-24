Ahmed Gaddaf al-Dam, a close aide to Gaddafi based in Cairo, told The Associated Press that he was aware of the millions of euros Gaddafi's government allegedly gave to Sarkozy. Investigators are examining allegations that Gaddafi's regime secretly gave Sarkozy $62m for his 2007 presidential campaign. Sarkozy has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. As president, Sarkozy put France in the forefront of the NATO-led air campaign in support of Libyan rebels in 2011. Gaddaf al-Dam says most of the Libyans involved in the money transfers are imprisoned, dead or fearing assassination.
