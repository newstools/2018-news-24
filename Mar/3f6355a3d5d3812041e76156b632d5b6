A woman and a child died when their shack caught fire on Saturday morning in Sweet Home Farm, Philippi. According to the City of Cape Town eight people were displaced. The cause of the fire is unknown. The South African Police Service (SAPS) is investigating. A shaken Nomakhaya Sinkwane, the daughter of the woman who died, said she was told by her neighbours at about 7am that her mother’s shack was burning. “I rushed there but could not help since the shack was all in flames,” she said. Neighbours had tried to put out the fire with buckets of water. Four people stayed in the shack but two had been away since the Friday night. Sinkwane’s 56-year-old mother had stayed in the shack for almost 15 years. Beds, food stuff, clothes and blankets were burnt to ashes. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
