A DEAD body, believed to be that of a man who has been missing since a drowning incident on Sunday, was found at Margate beach on Wednesday morning. The body could be that of the man who was swept away by a strong current while swimming with his friend at Margate beach on Sunday evening. Jason Clive Swart, a Lazer 911 Security back-up reaction officer, was first to discover the man’s body. Swart told the Fever that an eyewitness who watched the drowning unfold on Sunday, told him that both men were walking on the rocks near Margate Pier when they fell into the water and got swept in by the current. “The one friend managed to get out of the current but the other got stuck and drowned,” he said. “I came across the man’s body while patrolling Finis Road as it is a hot spot, so I went and did a quick patrol before standing down from my shift. “On my way back, I noticed the body right there on the beach.” Swart then contacted his control room who then alerted the local police. “I only got closer to the body when the investigating officer appeared. Most of the man’s skin had peeled off due to the ocean’s sea water,” he said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Zandra Wiid said the body has not yet been confirmed to be that of the missing swimmer. “A body was seen this morning close to the pier at Margate where it had washed up. “The body was taken to the mortuary for a post mortem and possible identification,” said Wiid.
