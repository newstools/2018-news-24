The children, aged between seven and nine years, were asleep when the fire started. It is alleged that the mother was working a night shift and had left the children in the house when the incident happened. Siyamthanda and Nothando Duma were pupils at a local primary school in Verulam in Grades 4 and 2, respectively. According to the family spokesperson Phelokwazi Mhlongo, her brother Zukile Mhlongo [father of the children] received a call from his sister-in-law about her boyfriend who had been stabbed. “He was sleeping in the house with the children when he was alerted that his sister-in-law needed help. “He went out to call an ambulance. He locked the door and did not realise that a candle was burning. We suspect that the candle fell on the floor and the fire spread throughout the house. “Our neighbours said they heard the children screaming for help, but could not help as the flames were powerful. “We are really puzzled about how the fire broke out. “The firefighters were alerted, but when they arrived it was too late,” she said. The blaze also destroyed food, clothes and crucial documents that were inside the house. Police spokesperson in Verulam, Captain Henry Kisten, said: “A case of inquest is being investigated.” Ward 60 councillor Fakazi Mdletshe said: “The one-room shack was burnt to ashes with the two children inside and nothing came out of that house. “I therefore make a humble request to anyone who can assist the family rebuild their house, and assist with clothes and food,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
