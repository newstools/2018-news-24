Police spokesperson, Sergeant Majola Nkohli, said the woman had been a passenger in a silver Peugeot, which had been travelling in the direction of Port Elizabeth. Nkohli said a second vehicle, a Nissan Bakkie with a trailer, also travelling towards Port Elizabeth had apparently stopped on the side of the road, due to a puncture. He said the driver of the Peugeot had apparently swerved to avoid colliding with the trailer, and had apparently lost control of the vehicle, which veered off the road and rolled. “A 46-year-old woman, who was a passenger in the Peugeot, was declared dead at the scene.  Three other injured passengers, including a driver, were taken to Humansdorp Hospital,” he said. Nkohli said police were investigating a case of culpable homicide. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
