Tillerson is speaking at a joint news conference with Chad's Foreign Minister Mahamat Zene (zen) Cherif in the country's capital, N'Djamena (en-jah-mee-nah). Tillerson says the visa restrictions were necessary because of "all the conflict that exists on Chad's borders". Tillerson says Chad has taken important, positive steps to strengthen control over its passports and improve information-sharing. He says he believes those steps will "allow us to begin to normalize the travel relationship with Chad." But he says the decision will have to await a final report the US will prepare later in March. Zene says that Chad's President Idriss Deby "expressed his incomprehension" to Tillerson about the restrictions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
