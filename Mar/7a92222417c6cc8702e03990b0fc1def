Boipelo Mere “Daarsy, Bheki Cele maak julle reg. Hy sê hy soek nie vet polisie nie, julle moet oefen.” This humorous remark was made by a taxi driver on Thursday (15/03) morning when members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) took to the streets of the Kimberley central business district (CBD) on foot, with their police dogs, on horses and in cars. “I was not aware they are also allowed to march,” shouted one onlooker who was shooting a video. The massive parade was led by Lt Gen. Risimati Shivuri, Northern Cape police commissioner. Members of various divisions of police management and the management of the provincial community policing board also took part. The action followed a SAPS management meeting held to finalise the 2018-’19 Annual Performance Plan, which aims to ensure that the communities of the Northern Cape are safe. The police members on parade were reclaiming the Kimberley CBD, while promoting good health among members. The car parade and parade on foot started at the Phakamile Mabija Police Station and proceeded throughout the CBD. According to Brig. Mohale Ramatseba, the operation commenced with a parade held at the Kimberley SAPS Parade Ground, where Shivuri emphasised the importance of crime prevention. All deputy provincial commissioners, provincial heads, provincial commanders, cluster commanders, station commanders, branch commanders and unit commanders participated. Ephraim Homan, chairperson of the provincial community policing board and T-Man Tafel, public relations officer of the board, are also reported to have participated. Divisions that participated are the mounted unit, the K9 unit, the public order police, the tactical response team, the flying squad, the visible policing unit, as well as paramedics and representatives of labour unions. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
