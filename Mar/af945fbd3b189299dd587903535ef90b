The bust came after police followed up on information received from the public about drugs being sold to high school learners. In a quick response, police on duty made their way to the identified address. Police searched the premises through a separate entrance and found a large quantity of Mandrax and dagga bankies with an estimated value of R15 000, along with two scales. Four men – aged between 18 and 27 – were found on the premises and were immediately detained by police. A young man in school uniform, belonging to a local school in the area, was among those arrested. In another incident on Tuesday morning, police observed the driver of white Polo picking up passengers and driving suspiciously in front of them. Police stopped and searched the vehicle in 8th Avenue, Grassy Park and found a toiletry bag filled with cocaine and ecstasy with an estimated value of R40 000. The suspects in both incidents appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court last week on charges related to dealing or the possession of drugs and were released on bail. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
