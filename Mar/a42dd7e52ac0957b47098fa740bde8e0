Watch. WATCH A small group of people claiming to be Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members used a vehicle to block the gates at New Brighton Clinic in Port Elizabeth on Thursday, demanding that staff members continue to provide medical services. The members prevented clinic staff from leaving the premises, claiming that the clinic did not want to help EFF members, police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said. "After SAPS intervention, it was agreed that [a] memorandum will be handed over at a later stage to the provincial health director and the gates were opened for staff to leave," Beetge added. Provincial Department of Health spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said district management was dealing with the issue. He explained that clinic staff members started work later than usual because they were traumatised by a series of recent break-ins. "Community members claiming to be EFF members went to the clinic to ask the staff not to close for the day until all the patients were assisted," he said. "The nurses must work for the community because these clinics belong to the community. They must work together." The EFF could not be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
