The suspect was arrested after police traced and apprehended him on Saturday afternoon, less than a day after the victims were attacked while busy with stop and search operations at the corner of Leyds and Esselen streets in Sunnyside on Friday night at 23:00. The 34-year-old constable died in hospital, while the 41-year-old officer was recovering well. Spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said she could not confirm if the officers had been stabbed, saying police were awaiting a forensics outcome to determine the exact nature of the attack in which both sustained injuries to their upper bodies. Gauteng police commissioner Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange thanked especially the witnesses to the incident, who she said played a crucial role in ensuring the arrest. "We hope that this will assist the family towards reconciling with the loss of their loved one, while we allow the law to take its course," she said. The suspect is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
