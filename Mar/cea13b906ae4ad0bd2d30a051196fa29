"There were minor injuries… Those people have recovered," said the centre's head Dr Elias Sithole. He said repairs would begin in affected areas on Monday. "Some of the areas where they have water damage, we are starting to repair damaged road and damaged infrastructure." Among the damaged infrastructure were bridges.
