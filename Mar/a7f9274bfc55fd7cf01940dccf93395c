husband to stand down after last year’s military takeover when he was
determined not to, it has emerged. Grace Mugabe made the claim during a surprise press
conference her husband gave at the couple’s Harare mansion this week. 'It was me who urged him to resign' "Baba (father) did not want to put pen to paper, in fact it
was me who urged him to resign for the sake of peace because Baba did not want
to,” Grace Mugabe said, in comments carried by the private NewsDay. Mugabe confirmed his wife's role in helping to persuade him.
“Under the circumstances I didn’t want to step down because I felt it was not
proper and I insisted that everything was done unconstitutionally,” the
94-year-old said. ‘Anarchy and bloodshed’ He said he was willing to face impeachment proceedings by
MPs from his party and the main opposition but his wife had convinced him that
“the process would take long and in between, the country could plunge into
anarchy and bloodshed.” Mugabe told reporters that last November’s takeover was a
“military coup” – a phrase his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa has done everything
to avoid. Mnangagwa’s office has shrugged off the criticism, insisting
on Friday that while Mugabe was free to express himself the country had “moved
on”. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
