"Four attackers were neutralised in the attack on the French embassy," the government in a statement posted on its Information Service website. A parallel attack targeting the headquarters of the Burkinabe armed forces left two dead, Information Minister Remis Fulgance Dandjinou told the state TV channel RTB. "A certain number of gendarmes and soldiers" were wounded, but there were no known casualties among civilians, he said. The attack "has strong overtones of terrorism," the minister said. In Paris, a French diplomatic source said there had been no French casualties. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
