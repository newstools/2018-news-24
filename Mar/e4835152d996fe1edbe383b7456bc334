A notice on the university's website on Friday said that, while staff at the KwaDlangezwa campus were "advised" to return to work on Monday, campus facilities would still be closed to students. "No student will be allowed access to the KwaDlangezwa campus until further notice," the notice read. Police arrested thirty-two students on Thursday after a building and two police vehicles were set on fire. The university then announced that it was closing the campus. Speaking to News24, student representative council deputy president Ndumiso Ntshangase condemned the damage caused to property. "I have to say that is not what we are about. Even if we have grievances, the university property is our own. It should not be damaged." Ntshangase said students decided to protest after they had not received their meal allowance on Thursday. He said students were prepared to negotiate with management. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
