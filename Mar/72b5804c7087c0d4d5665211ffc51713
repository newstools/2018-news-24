According to prosecutor Nomapa Mvandaba, releasing the sixth accused of bail could affect the investigation. "There is a lot of evidence concealed at this stage. Investigations are pending and can be hampered by his release," she said. She did not divulge any further details. The sixth accused, who cannot be identified until the identification parade is conducted, appeared in court on Thursday. While it was previously reported that the man was being investigated for the unlawful possession of a firearm, it emerged in court that he is being investigated for the murders as well. The man, who was arrested on Tuesday at the controversial Seven Angels Ministry, faces five counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances.

The Seven Angels Ministry, a church just outside Ngcobo, came into the spotlight a few days later on Saturday, when seven people suspected of being involved in the murders, were shot dead. Newly-appointed Minister of Police Bheki Cele told the National Assembly on Wednesday that the five suspects confessed that they had conspired to rob the Capitec Bank ATM opposite the police station and had identified the police station as a place to get firearms.
