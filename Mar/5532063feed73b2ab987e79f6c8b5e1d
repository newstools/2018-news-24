The swift reaction of Uitenhage K9 police officials resulted in them apprehending two male suspects found in possession of 2.7 tons of stolen meat with an estimated value of R144 000. According to police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart, the suspects allegedly hijacked a company truck at about 08:50 last Friday morning. The driver and his two passengers were en route from Markman in Port Elizabeth towards Somerset East, with a meat delivery, when they stopped at an intersection on the N2, close to Coega. “The suspects were driving a white VW Polo which suddenly stopped next to the truck and they threatened the truck crew with firearms,” said Captain Swart. “The suspects ordered two passengers to climb into the back of the delivery truck, two suspects then got into the truck and instructed the driver to drive towards Despatch. “The suspects then ordered the driver to stop next to the road and the boxes of meat were off-loaded into a second vehicle. “The driver and the suspects then drove off to Khayamnandi where they were tied up and left behind. The suspects fled in their VW Polo from the scene,” said Captain Swart. Community members discovered the truck and victims and notified Despatch police of the incident. Police officials from Uitenhage K9 arrived on the scene and immediately followed up on information, which led them to Daku Street in Kwazakhele, where two suspects were busy off-loading the meat at a business. The police recovered all the stolen meat and two suspects were arrested and appeared in the Motherwell Magistrate’s Court last Monday on a charge of possession of suspected stolen goods. Police are following up various leads and further arrests are expected. -HEILIE COMBRINCK
