Mxolisi Mngadi Johannesburg â€“ The South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has confirmed that its members will go on strike on Tuesday morning over the implementation of the bus rapid transport (BRT) system in Ekurhuleni, in Gauteng's East Rand.

Santaco tweeted on Monday: "Please be advised taxi strike in Ekurhuleni continues. From the report, the strike will involve all taxi leaders, owners and drivers in the metro which means no taxi will be working. We call on the organisers to ensure the strike takes place under orderly and peaceful conditions." The council later apologised to commuters for the strike in a second tweet. "We further advise them to make alternative transport arrangements as no taxi will be operating tomorrow. The strike involves taxi leaders, owners and drivers," it said. The City of Ekurhuleni also said there would be no Harambee bus service on Tuesday due to the strike. The municipality tweeted: "There will be no Harambee bus service on Tuesday, 20 March 18 due to the Ekurhuleni taxi industry strike. The City of Ekurhuleni apologises for the inconvenience.
