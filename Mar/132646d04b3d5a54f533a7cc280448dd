South Africa following the outbreak of Listeria. This came following reports that four other countries in southern
Africa had also taken steps on Monday against importation of South African chilled meat made at a factory found to be the origin of the world's worst-ever listeria
outbreak. Mozambique and Namibia announced
they were immediately suspending imports of the products. Botswana said it was
recalling the items "with immediate effect", while Zambia called on
South African retail chains in its country to pull the incriminated goods from
local shelves. According to the state-owned Herald newspaper, the permanent secretary in
the ministry of health and child welfare, Gerald Gwiji, said that although
Zimbabwe had not yet recorded any cases of Listeria, the country had already activated
its surveillance teams to monitor importation of such products into the
country. "What makes this outbreak
significant for us is that we do import quite significant food items,
particularly cold processed foods into Zimbabwe from South Africa. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
