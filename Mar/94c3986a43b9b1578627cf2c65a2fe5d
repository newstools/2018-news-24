"It's an incredibly sad day for me to leave Radio 702. I've been with the station and... [EWN] for so long, it's been my home, my family, for so much of my life. And I've learnt so much, and watched so much history happen. But I'm excited about the future, and my place in it." Grootes could not be reached by News24 to confirm the news.  When asked about Grootes, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago responded that all radio stations were going through changes, and that he would not deal with any individual changes just yet. "Once they have finalised their line-ups and signed all their deals with whoever, we will then announce. At this moment, until that is done, I have indicated to them that I don't even want to know who they are talking to or who they are not talking to," Kganyago said. He said the new line-ups would be announced next week.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
