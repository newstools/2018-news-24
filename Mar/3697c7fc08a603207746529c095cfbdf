At the time Moorosi was the chief financial officer at the municipality. It is also alleged that the two received "gratification" from the company.

Following investigations, the charges against the MEC were reinstated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
