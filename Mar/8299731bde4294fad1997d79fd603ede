weren’t that bad" in terms of human rights. Mugabe, who presided over years of economic collapse and
political turmoil in once-prosperous Zimbabwe, told Britain's ITV News: "In
comparison to other countries in Africa there is greater prosperity here." Watch as Mugabe speaks in the video below "People have their land; they won't starve in this country,
which in other countries happens," the 94-year-old said earlier this week as he
made his first comments to the international press since he was persuaded to
step down in November. He was replaced by his former deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa,
who's vowed to hold free and fair elections later this year. Errors were made Mugabe admitted that "errors" were made under his government
with regards to not safeguarding human rights. "That's a very difficult area. I agree we offended with
regard to that area in relation to how we handled the opposition, the
violence," he said at his mansion in Harare. But he added: "We weren't that bad
in comparison to other countries." Army imposed Mnangagwa Mugabe's claim that he was forced to resign won't please the
new government, which has tried to avoid the events of November being labelled
a coup. Mugabe said Mnangagwa had been imposed by the army. But he said Mnangagwa's promise of free and fair elections
was "a good start". "A promise is not the reality. It's just a promise. Fine if
he's promising at least it’s a good start and I'm prepared to join him in
making the process – the promise – a reality," Mugabe said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
