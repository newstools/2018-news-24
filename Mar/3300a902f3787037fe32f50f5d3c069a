"More than 200 individuals" will need to be "rooted out of the judiciary to ensure only real magistrates remain." Several of the most flagrant cases have resulted in arrests since the commission began its operations. The minister said others had simply vanished. "These individuals who entered the judiciary in irregular fashion have done substantial damage with regard to the administration of justice," he added, vowing they would face legal action.
