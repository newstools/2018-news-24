Alisa Bodner, a spokeswoman for the Struggle for Ethiopian Aliyah, called on Israel to resolve the issue without further delay. Nearly 8 000 Ethiopians want Israel to approve their immigration, allowing them to join their families in Israel. Although many are practicing Jews, Israel doesn't consider them Jewish, meaning their immigration requires special approval. The families see the issue as part of an inconsistent and discriminatory immigration policy. Parliament approved a 2019 budget early on Thursday with no allocation for the immigration. Bodner says the issue is expected to come up in a government committee at an unknown date. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
