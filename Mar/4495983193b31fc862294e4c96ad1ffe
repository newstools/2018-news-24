The fun-filled event will kick start at 08:15 with a 5km fun run all within the borders of the quarry. Explaining the reason behind the event, DRC member Zelda Trytsman said, “Having the quarry so close was an interesting place for a fun run some 20 years ago. However, for some years after that nothing seemed to happen and then we realised again the advantage of having a nature reserve on our doorstep.” Trytsman said La Farge, the company running the quarry, had always been very kind to its neighbours, aware of the community around them and are trying to restore the part of the quarry which is not being used anymore for quarry purposes. “We spoke to La Farge about the idea of having a complete day of fun within the borders of the quarry and ended up with the fun run,” Trytsman said. She said because the event is outdoors, the weather conditions are sometimes a challenge. “Two years ago we had some wind and a few years back we started of with a bit of rain.” The event will also have interesting stalls, plenty of eats and families can come and enjoy a picnic in the tranquility of the reserve. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
