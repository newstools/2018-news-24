Set down for May 21, Eben van Niekerk, Nashwill Julies, Vernon Witbooi and Geraldo Parsons will listen to the evidence against them a year after Cornelius's murder. The case was postponed to April 20 in the Western Cape High Court on Friday to allow the accused's lawyers to prepare. Prosecutor Lenro Badenhorst said the proceedings, which are expected to last between four and six weeks, could be shortened if the four accused make any formal admissions.
