Kasala police chief Yahi Sulayman said it took place when worshippers had gathered for evening prayers in a mosque in Kasala city which borders Eritrea. "Three people have been killed and several wounded," Sulayman said. A medic at a hospital where the wounded were brought said they had been stabbed. Residents said the attacker had tried to address worshippers who refused to listen to him and then started stabbing them. "People in the mosque then retaliated and killed the attacker," Sulayman said, adding that the identity of the attacker had not been established.

Officials say the decision to declare emergency was part of a government campaign to collect illegal arms in the state. Hundreds of Sudanese soldiers have been deployed in Kasala in recent months, residents say. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent by
