The two were arrested by troops on Saturday in the village of Bukundo, where the pair were found murdered, the deputy governor of Central Kasai province, Manix Kabuanga, told AFP. The militia chief was named as Vincent Manga, while the policeman was not identified. The two "are currently in the hands of the military judiciary," a source at the military prosecutor's office in Kananga, the provincial capital, said. The two experts, Swedish-Chilean Zaida Catalan and American Michael Sharp, were investigating reports of mass graves in the Kasai region, where fierce fighting had erupted the previous year.

On December 20, an investigation by Radio France Internationale (RFI) and Reuters implicated three state agents in the "organisation" of the attack. A senior army official, asked by AFP to react to the latest developments, said the arrests marked "a significant advance" in the probe. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
