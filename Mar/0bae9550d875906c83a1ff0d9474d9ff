The case comes as critics accuse President John Magufuli of being intolerant of dissent in the East African nation. A statement by the court in Dar es Salaam says Freeman Mbowe and the other Chadema party members have been denied bail. The charges are related to their alleged roles in a protest last month during which police allegedly shot and killed a student. Also last month an opposition lawmaker was sentenced to five months in jail after he was convicted of insulting Magufuli. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
