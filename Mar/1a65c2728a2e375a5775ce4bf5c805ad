A Libyan official said the attack on Friday targeted a checkpoint on the outskirts of the town of Ajdabiya manned by the self-styled Libyan National Army, fighters loyal to Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, who are battling Islamic militants in eastern Libya. The extremists claimed the attack in a statement released late on Saturday. Libya was plunged into chaos after a popular uprising in 2011 and is today split between rival authorities backed by an array of militias.
