Convicted rapist Siphenathi Ntantiso, 20, was arrested earlier in the day in Kleinvlei after he and five others broke out of the correctional centre's B5 section at around 23:00 on Sunday. They are believed to have escaped by using a piece of metal, obtained by breaking a bed, to remove bars. The other rearrested inmates were apprehended on Monday in Kalksteenfontein, Blackheath and Ocean View. Western Cape regional commissioner Delekile Klaas said members of the department's emergency support team and police had initially committed to capturing the six within 72 hours, but instead rearrested all convicts within 48 hours. "But, our special thanks should also go to members of our communities for having provided intelligence on the whereabouts of the escapees," Klaas said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
