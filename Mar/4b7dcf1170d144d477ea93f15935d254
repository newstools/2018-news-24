During his first interview since his ousting, Mugabe said the army's intervention was "a coup" and that his successor, Mnangagwa, was in power "illegally". Those remarks caused anger within the ruling Zanu-PF party, which then threatened to expel him and strip him of the privileges he enjoys as a former head of state. According to reports, the tension between Mugabe and his successor escalated when the veteran leader was said to be backing a new political outfit. A former army brigadier, Ambrose Mutinhiri, who quit Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party to protest the removal of Mugabe, was reported to be the leader of the new political party. State media said that Mutinhiri, a veteran of the 1970s war against white minority rule, had Mugabe's backing. Mutinhiri's resigned from parliament recently, citing the military intervention that pressured 94-year-old Mugabe into stepping down in November as his reason for cutting ties with the ruling party. But, according to Daily News, the two politicians are set to meet next month to iron out their differences. The pair were said to be working on the agenda of their talks which would be held in April. According to Bulawayo.com, the agenda for the upcoming meeting remained a closely guarded secret.
