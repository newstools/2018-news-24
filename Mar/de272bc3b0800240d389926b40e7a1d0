Many of the illegal car washes have popped up around informal settlements and they have left residents fuming. Some residents from Khan Road have said that taxis are using the informal settlements’ access to free water to wash their cars free of charge illegally on a residential      road. “They must be fined — we need to find out who these taxis belong to and who they are associated with, and then fine them and make sure they pay for their usage of the water,” said a Khan Road resident, Joackim Naidoo. Another resident suggested that the water supply should be diverted to a point that the taxis won’t have access to, to prevent them from using free water which is meant for the informal settlements. “We must see to it that these taxis do not exploit the camp dwellers. “If that means us finding a way to move the water supply so that these taxi drivers won’t be able to get to it, then so be it,” said Copesville resident Byron Thambu. Taxi association spokesperson Bheki Sokhela said that the taxi association was not aware of the illegal car washes but said that they will be investigated promptly. Municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha, in responding to a query, stated that the matter will be investigated now that it has been brought to the municipality’s attention. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
