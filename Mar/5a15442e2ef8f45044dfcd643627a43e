Christina Pitt An employee at Klerksdorp Old Age Home in the North West opened a case of common assault and crimen injuria against a National Health and Education Union (Nehawu) member on Thursday. Nehawu provincial spokesperson Patrick Makhafane said one of their members, who is a shop steward, clashed with the home's manager. He, however, claimed that it was the manager who lashed out first. "They were discussing work-related manners, which resulted in an argument. The manager started manhandling the member and the argument was characterised by racial remarks," said Makhafane. "The members at the old age home then revolted and the manager was then suspended," he continued. "No arrest has been made at this stage," police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
