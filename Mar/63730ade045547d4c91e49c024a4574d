"Returning from a successful military operation against the jihadists' main base in Dialloube, where ten terrorists were neutralised, an army vehicle drove over a mine, killing four soldiers," said a military source at the defence ministry. A foreign military source confirmed the deaths, adding that two other soldiers were seriously injured.

Four UN peacekeepers were killed and four were wounded last week when a mine exploded under their vehicle in central Mali.
