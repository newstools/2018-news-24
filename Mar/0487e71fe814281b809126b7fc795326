The team came under attack Sunday while traveling near Markounda, a remote northwestern area near the border with Chad. "We strongly condemn this senseless act against aid workers who were there to improve the lives of the most vulnerable populations," said Unicef's West and Central Africa regional director, Marie-Pierre Poirier. The Unicef said it has no further details. Central African Republic has faced deadly interreligious and intercommunal fighting since 2013, when predominantly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in the capital, Bangui. Mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias fought back, resulting in thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news from around the continent
