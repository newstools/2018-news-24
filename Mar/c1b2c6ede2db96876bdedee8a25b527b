City of Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said the couple's Macassar home was set alight at 03:00, while they were asleep, in the early hours of Monday. After the fire department arrived and extinguished the blaze, two beer bottles were found on the premises. "It is suspected that it was filled with a flammable liquid and used as incendiary devices by whoever attacked the premises," he said. "The officers lost all their possessions, and they and their child are severely traumatised." The City had, in the interim, provided the officers with temporary accommodation outside of the area until the matter was fully investigated by police and it was safe for them to return, Dyason said. It is believed that the couple, who live in a home behind the main house on the property, were targeted in the attack. A Wendy house on the same erf was also destroyed. "They lost all their belongings, even their uniforms," Dyason said. The two officers had been placed on special leave to recover from the incident, he added. Western Cape police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk confirmed an arson case was being investigated. No arrests have been made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
