The three-day programme was attended by authors, storytellers and poets. On Tuesday, Grade 1, 2 and 3 pupils were taught about how to tell stories and stories were presented.    Author Fortunate Maphumulo read her book Tom and his Friends to pupils under a tree and ensured the pupils understood its meaning. Grade 4 to Grade 8 pupils were encouraged to read and write poems. Lwazi Mbambo, the King Harvest Academy marketing and communications manager, said people do not use community libraries and as a result, they lack knowledge. He said it is important for pupils to visit libraries for research and assignments. “We want to bring back the culture of reading to our communities,” said Mbambo. Pupils presented their poems during the programme. A book and a writing club will be launched today. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
