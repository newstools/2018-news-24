The parts that are produced using this additive manufacturing process meet all the original engineering specifications, both from a technical and a visual perspective. Porsche is currently 3D-printing nine parts, including the release lever for the clutch on the Porsche 959, of which only 292 were made. A further 20 parts that have been 3D-printed are being destruction tested. The parts in question are steel and alloy parts produced using the selective laser melting process, and plastic components manufactured by using an SLS printer. SLS stands for selective laser sintering, a process where the material is heated to just below melting point and the remaining energy is applied through a laser to fuse the plastic powder at a selected point. All parts are subject to the quality requirements of the original production period as a minimum, although they usually meet higher standards. Accuracy in terms of size and fit is ensured by performing tests with the part installed. Depending on the area of application, plastic parts made of various materials must, as in the original, be resistant to oils, fuels, acids and light. — Supplied. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
