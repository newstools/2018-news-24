Sesona Ngqakamba Rand Water has distanced itself from the water shortages in the Emfuleni Local Municipality. The utility's spokesperson, Justice Mohale, said technical representatives and the municipality had determined that the municipality's pumps in its pressure tower were not operational. "The pressure tower is responsible for supplying water to the high-lying areas of Emfuleni, and as this was not operating as normal, water supply was not reaching these high-lying areas," he said. The municipality owes Rand Water about R500m. Mohale said a 10% water flow restriction was in place due to the municipality's outstanding debt. He added that as a result the municipality's Vanderbijlpark Reservoir meter was restricted to a flow rate of 53.6 million litres per day. "Our systems indicate that the current actual flow rate from the Rand Water meter to the Vanderbijlpark Reservoir is at 54.3 million liters per day," he said. He said that any water shortages that were experienced by end users were therefore not as a consequence of the current credit control action the utility had in place with the municipality. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
