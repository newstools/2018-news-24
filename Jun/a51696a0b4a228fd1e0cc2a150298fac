Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said on Tuesday that the woman had managed to "grab the baby during the incident" on Monday night. The car was later retrieved and a case of carjacking is being investigated. "It is alleged yesterday (Monday) at 18:25, the victim was driving her vehicle out of the driveway at Partham Road in Avoca, with her 11-month-old baby in the car, when she noticed a silver VW Polo drive past her. The vehicle stopped a few metres away and three unknown men came running towards her. At gunpoint, they forced her out," she said. Mbhele said the armed men then fled the scene in the woman’s white Mercedes Benz, but not before the mom was able to retrieve her child. It was earlier reported that the hijackers had driven off with the child and had then turned around to return the baby to the mom. Andreas Mathios, spokesperson for private security company Blue Security said in a statement earlier that, when the hijackers fled, they did not realise that the baby was still in the car. Police, however, denied this. * This story has been updated to correct earlier information. Our previous story said, as fact, that the hijackers had returned the baby. Police have however since said that this was not the case.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
