Their official duties will commence on Sunday, July 1. "Previously, the City outsourced its security services through over 150 contracts with service providers paying on average R14 000 per security guard, while the guards themselves received as little as R4500 as a salary per month," the City said in a statement.

According to the City, the success of the project "signifies the good work we can achieve under the leadership of …mayor Herman Mashaba, and our coalition partners working with the EFF".
