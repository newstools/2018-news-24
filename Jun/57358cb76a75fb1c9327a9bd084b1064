It is believed four men who were wearing beanies and hats entered the mall and went to the jewellery store where they smashed the window with a hammer. The suspects fired shots before speeding off when security officers tried to stop the men from fleeing. The men escaped with an unknown number of Rolex watches. No one was injured during the incident. "The suspects are still at large and anybody that can assist the Brooklyn SAPS with information can contact the station," police spokesperson Colette Weilbach said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
