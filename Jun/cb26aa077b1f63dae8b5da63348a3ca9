 A Grassy
Park man has killed himself after killing his wife on Monday morning. Grassy Park
police spokesperson Warrant Officer Wynita Kleinsmith confirms that they were
called out to Brookford Road at 08:00, saying that the man turned the gun on
himself after his wife was shot. City of
Cape Town’s executive director for safety and security Richard Bosman confirms
that the 32-year-old man was once involved as a part-time Law Enforcement
officer. “The City can
confirm that the person in question was an auxiliary (part-time) Law Enforcement
officer, but no longer has any association with the City of Cape Town,” says
Bosman.
