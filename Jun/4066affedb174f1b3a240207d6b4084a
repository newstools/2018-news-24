City services would be requested to be on standby to deal with these adverse weather conditions, Powell confirmed. Incidents such as fallen tree branches and power outages should be reported to the City's call centre on 0860 103 089, while emergencies can be directed to the public emergency communication centre on 021 480 7700 from a cellphone or 107 from a landline, she advised. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
