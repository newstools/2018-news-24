Novella allegedly killed Gabriella Kabrins Albans in an upmarket hotel in Camps Bay on July 29, 2015. Novella, who was declared a suicide risk in court last Monday, had testified in February that he hit Albans and defecated on her because he thought she was a demonic entity. He then placed a piece of paper on her body with the word "cerote" written on it. The word means "piece of sh*t" in Spanish. Novella's advocate, William Booth, told News24 he had told the court he was concerned about his client's emotional and mental wellbeing after the startling statements, and the judge had wanted Novella examined. He also wanted Novella to be examined by a private psychiatrist, in addition to the district surgeon.
