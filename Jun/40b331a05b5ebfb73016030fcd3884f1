The 38-year-old, whose name is being withheld in the interests of the child, was captured in a dramatic series of pictures, first as he threatened to throw her off the roof of a shack in Joe Slovo informal settlement, and eventually as he did. The child was caught by a metro police officer, Constable Luyolo Nojulumba.

He had previously been accompanied by members of the Joe Slovo community, who had protested outside the court in support of him. The matter was transferred to the regional court, before being postponed to June 22 for further consultation. In May the State downgraded the charges against him from attempted murder to child abuse, and he was released on a warning.
