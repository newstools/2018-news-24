Matthew Breet's case for the alleged possession of illegal weaponry and ammunition was postponed after it emerged that the lawyer his mother had arranged for him had not arrived. Wearing a heavy grey jacket, bearing the words "Tactical Unit", the tall and freshly-scrubbed looking man in his late twenties said he was surprised to have been let down. "I know that he was supposed to have been here this morning," he told Magistrate Michelle Adams. "My mother was in contact with him yesterday." Breet's appearance on Wednesday was related to the alleged discovery of the firepower in his unmarked Jeep in Sea Point in August 2017. His arrest came shortly after the murder of Wainstein, whose body was found in his home in Constantia days earlier on August 18. Breet's Sea Point firearm matter was postponed until July 23 to enable him to get his legal representation in order. He was placed back in custody at the Drakenstein Prison in Paarl. His court appearance diary is fairly full, with Breet and his apparent police informant brother Sheldon facing charges of murder, along with Cheslin Adams and Fabian Cupido, for Wainstein's killing.
