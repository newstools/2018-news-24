woman spotted the infant's elbow and foot poking out of the ground. The horrified woman, identified as Nguyen Thi Thuy Truc,
spotted the shocking sight near her home in the commune of Tan Thang, Ham Tan
District, Binh Thuan province, southern Vietnam. The shocked 31-year-old then called her husband and he then
unearthed the tiny tot. They said the infant was still breathing, but he had
several wounds on his little body. After cleaning the worst of the dirt off they rushed him to
a nearby hospital, where doctors said they believed the child to be about a day
old. The infant weighed around 2 kg and still had the umbilical
chord attached to his bellybutton. After treating the various injuries the baby
was transferred to the larger General Hospital of La Gi town for further
treatment. The local council leader, Do Tan Si, said local police were
investigating. He said nobody had any idea who the mother of the child was. Source: MAGAZINE
