Samantha Lee @Samantha_Lee121 Since the beginning of the 2017/18 financial year, more than 4000 title deeds have been handed over to residents in areas across Mitchell’s Plain, Pelican Park, Wallacedene, Athlone, Bonteheuwel and many other areas. This is a continuation of the work started during the 2011 to 2016 term of office when more than 11 000 title deeds were issued to residents. For the current 2017/18 financial year, around 4330 title deeds have been handed over to residents. This as mayor Patricia de Lille handed over an additional 100 title deeds to residents at the Bellville Civic Centre last week. Among them were residents from Matroosfontein, Manenberg, Elsies River, Bishop Lavis, Uitsig, Nyanga, Guglethu and Goodwood. “[This] is a firm demonstration of our commitment to build a caring and inclusive city where everyone feels like this is home and where they belong. We are going to make it official for all who will now be homeowners,” she said at the event. Title deed handovers took place in Tafelsig, Pelican Park, Eastridge and Beacon Valley since December last year, with hundreds of residents having already received their deeds. This will be accompanied by many more within the areas as the processes are in place, officials confirmed recently. By January, more than 140 residents had received their title deeds in wards 79, 82 and 99 with some having waited close to 40 years (“Inwoners word eienaars ná meer as 30 jaar”, People’s Post, 30 January). In April, there was also an additional 120 deeds handed over to residents from the New Horizons and Pelican Park areas. This too featured residents who had been on the City’s housing waiting list for more than 30 years (“Deeds for local residents”, People’s Post, 17 April). This was followed by another handover to close to 100 residents from Mitchell’s Village with an additional 99 in the pipeline, officials confirmed at the meeting in May, (“100 inwoners word eienaars”, People’s Post, 15 May). “Since last year the City has ramped up the process of handing title deeds to residents so that the homes can officially be theirs. In the 2016/17 financial year, the City handed 1182 title deeds to residents in historical housing projects and 760 title deeds to residents living in Council saleable rental stock,” added De Lille. The title deed handovers follows a promise made by the council in 2015 where it was decided that around 41 000 properties would be handed over to residents on the Cape Flats as a means of redress. The properties were all formally City rental stock and are formally signed over to the residents as their own. “The City’s work in this important redress project ensures that residents are confirmed as the rightful property owners. We wish you all many happy years in your homes. Please take care of them,” she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
