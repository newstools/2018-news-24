Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Hazel Mqala said residents of Fynbos and Egoli Buffalo Flats embarked on protests over poor service delivery and the allocation of RDP houses. Mqala said community members had used burning tyres to barricade Black Road and were throwing stones at passing vehicles. She said the residents had been addressed by Buffalo City Mayor Xola Pakati on Thursday, but this had not satisfied them, and protests continued. Mqala said members of the public order policing unit had to use stun grenades and rubber bullets to disperse the unruly crowds. Mqala said so far six protesters had been arrested in terms of the Public Violence Act. "Despite this, community members are still continuing to burn tyres and other objects in the streets at four different hotspot areas," she said. Mqala said all roads leading from Black Road into Buffalo Flats were still closed due to the protests.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
