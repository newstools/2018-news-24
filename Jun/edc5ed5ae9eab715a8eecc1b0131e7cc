As the result of the protests, the road was closed in both directions between Duinefontein and Friedman roads, City of Cape Town traffic spokesperson Richard Coleman said. He added that there were about 300 people in the roadway. ANC councillor for the area Nkululeko Mgolombane, said the residents told him that their shacks were under threat of being demolished by the City. But he said he was not aware of a plan to demolish any structures on Wednesday. "It is a rumour. The City is not involved with that land. It is private land." The City's law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said that a "private" eviction sparked the violent protests and that four vehicles were set alight. His information was that the eviction did not go ahead because the crowd prevented further action. Dyason said around 11:00 that all services were on the scene and calm had been restored.
