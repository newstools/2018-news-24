remain in place until the scene is cleared and the police investigation is
complete – estimated duration 3 – 4 hours. Final mopping up operations will
commence as soon as forensic teams have completed their investigation," Scott said. Anyone with information or footage of the event is requested to hand it over to police. All reports will be investigated and treated in "strictest confidence". "Rewards of up to
