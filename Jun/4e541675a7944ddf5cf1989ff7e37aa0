Modise was a retired Chief of State Protocol and a recipient of the National Order of Luthuli. He has served as ambassador to Sweden and later Canada. In 1955, he left his hometown of Bloemfontein in the Free State to enroll at the University of Fort Hare where he was encouraged to join the African National Congress (ANC) by President Thabo Mbeki and Professor ZK Matthews. He was a student activist who mobilised young people and anti-apartheid activists throughout the world. When he was exiled to Sweden he raised funds for the ANC and was instrumental in raising awareness about the struggle against apartheid. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
