Police officers from the Elsburg police station in Germiston were called to the gruesome murder scene in Elsburg on Tuesday morning. According to Captain André de Jager, Johan Brody (64) first shot his two daughters, Ounooi (35) and Tanya (37). Johan then called his son, Dawid (38), who’d lived with his wife in an outside room on the property, and shot him as well before turning the gun on himself. Captain De Jager says a murder and suicide dossier had been opened, but that the motive for the murders are still unknown. Leonora de Jesus, a friend of the Brodys, told YOU that Johan had lost his job about three weeks ago when the company he’d been working for was liquidated. “They told him to take his stuff and go home,” she says. “He and his children lived a simple life. His children definitely looked up to him.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
