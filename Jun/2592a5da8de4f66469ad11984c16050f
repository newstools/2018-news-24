A video of the incident was widely circulated on social media on March 20. Watch. WATCH Two police officers, aged 33 and 40, were arrested for murder on Thursday following the discovery of a 43-year-old man's body in the Ennerdale police holding cells in Johannesburg. Innocent Sebediela was allegedly assaulted by the officers and detained without being registered in the relevant SAPS registers. "It is alleged that on June 13, Vispol (visible policing) were following information on a housebreaking and theft case. They apprehended seven suspects, whom they took to the holding cells," Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) spokesperson Moses Dlamini said in a statement. "The duty officer found the deceased's wet clothes in the cells and during investigation it was found that the deceased was assaulted and had water poured on to him." The death was reported to IPID. An investigation found that Sebediela had injuries all over his body and witness statements confirmed the alleged assault by the two police officers. Dlamini said that a medical examination confirmed that Sebediela died on Wednesday morning. The police officers will appear in the Protea Magistrate's Court on Friday on charges of murder. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
