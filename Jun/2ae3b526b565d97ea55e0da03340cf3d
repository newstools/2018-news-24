The broadcast van belonging to Muslim radio station Voice of the Cape was burgled outside Mitchells Plain Town Centre. Staff were broadcasting prayer services from the mosque for the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. "They stole our mixer, cables and mics. It's not good because that van is like my baby," technical manager Nazeem Petersen said. The windows of the van were smashed in. "The people who stole the equipment probably don't even know what it's worth."
