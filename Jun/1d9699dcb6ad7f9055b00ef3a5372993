"We condemn this incident in the strongest sense and with the contempt it deserves," she said in a statement. She urged that police seek help if they were experiencing any problems in their private life. "It is of utmost importance that our members consult with family members, colleagues, their local churches or parents if they are experiencing any challenges or seeking assistance in their personal life." Condolences were extended to family and friends. On Friday, an on-duty police officer allegedly shot and killed his wife near the entrance of Voorpos Primary School in East London.
