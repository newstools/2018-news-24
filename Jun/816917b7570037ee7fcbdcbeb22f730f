Fever Reporter POLICE have issued a warning regarding the sale of fake gold following the discovery of an irregular stone in the Harding area. Port Shepstone SAPS spokesperson, Lieutenant Colonel Zandra Wiid, said on Tuesday that police have been made aware of rocks that are being sold, under the guise of being gold, to unsuspecting buyers. The fake stone, which was discovered in Kwambuthuma Village last week, caused mayhem as residents flooded the suspected source area of the ‘gold’ to search for more. “It has come to the attention of the police that certain people in the Harding area use gold spray on pieces of rock and then try to sell it to unsuspecting community members as a precious metal,” said Wiid. “We want to caution community members not to fall prey to this scam but instead to report it immediately to the nearest police station. “Under no circumstances must residents pay any money to theses fraudsters,” said Wiid. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
