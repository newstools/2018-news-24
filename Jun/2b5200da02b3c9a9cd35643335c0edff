We come home from work at that time on Fridays and need to cook for our children. On Saturday this is the time when we are all at home using the electricity,” said Azaria Sheik from Northdale. One resident, Sharon Kathan, said that the schedule they had received was not correct as their lights had been cut at various intervals not concurring with the loadshedding schedule, causing many inconveniences. “On Saturday we were told that we won’t have lights from six to eight [pm] so we began to braai, only to find that our power was turned on within half an hour. “We are not complaining that our lights were switched on but it would be nice to receive accurate information so that we don’t waste money unnecessarily preparing,” said Kathan. In a statement by Eskom, the electricity provider said that some of their employees were working around the clock to ensure restoration to operations and supply, and that full recovery of the country’s power system will take approximately 10 days. “Some municipalities may take longer to restore load once load shedding has been terminated. If customers experience outages for longer periods than announced, please contact your supplier (Eskom or the municipality) as these may be localised power outages,” said the statement. Eskom advised residents to keep checking load shedding schedules on both Eskom and the municipal websites.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
