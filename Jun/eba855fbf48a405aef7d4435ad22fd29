Reporter THE world premiere of the play Return of the Moon – A glimpse of Sara Baartman, written and directed by Robert Lourens, will take place at The Barn Theatre, Port Elizabeth Opera House from June 20 to 23. The play is about the prejudices of Europe juxtaposed against the good reports of Europeans visiting Southern Africa, as seen through quotes and comments made by prominent European people of the age. This is then contrasted by an African view as seen through the speech given at the funeral of Sara Baartman. The play follows Sara though her crossing the ocean and her display in London as The Hottentot Venus, before moving on to her journey on the fair circuit and finally, her time in Paris. The play exposes truths and insights gained through extensive research. Interwoven are the stories of the Khoi-Khoi, the indigenous peoples, and how they relate to the Eurocentric world view. The cast of Return of the Moon – A glimpse of Sara Baartman includes Bennie Gerber, Kehly Windvogel, Marcia Ntoni, Marianah Lourens, Nina Fillis and Phillip Cowie. The play will be staged at The Barn Theatre, PE Opera House from June 20 to 23 at 19:00 and at 14:00 on the final day. Tickets are R100 each for a single or R150 for double and R50 for students and pensioners. Tickets will be sold at the door.
