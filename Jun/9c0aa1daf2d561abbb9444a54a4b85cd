Siphelele Nketo AFTER Waseem Azhar’s body was found hidden inside a plastic bag on Sunday, Kokstad activist Sheik Phiri called on people to stop being brutal. A case of murder was opened by Kokstad Police after 26-year-old Azhar was found, wearing his black and yellow tracksuit pants and a navy jacket, in a bag by a passerby who alerted police. The body was identified by Azhar’s family at the scene. Azhar was reported missing on May 29 when he did not return home after leaving to go shopping in Kokstad the previous day. “His body was found next to a bridge at D614 road outside Franklin. We suspected that he was strangled because his neck had injuries,” said SAPS spokesman Captain Dumisani Ncongo. Police also suspected that he was kidnapped before being killed. Phiri, who is also a television presenter on channel 345 on DSTV, said life depends on respecting, not killing, one another. “Azhar murder surprised me because we celebrated the ending of the Muslim fasting month few days ago. Fasting teaches people to respect other human beings and not to kill. “Whoever killed Azhar needs to face the consequences,” said Phiri. Azhar was buried during a religious Muslim ceremony in Kokstad on Monday. Police said no arrests have been made. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
