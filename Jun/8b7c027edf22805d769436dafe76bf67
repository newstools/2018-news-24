According to Mpumalanga education department spokesperson Gerald Sambo, this brings the number of schools that have been torched in the province in the past five days to four. "What concerns the department most is that Ditau Secondary School is among the schools which are underperforming and that this development compromises efforts aimed at improving learner performance." The torching of the school means that its 407 pupils will not write examinations that were due to take place on Thursday. Classes have also been suspended. "The department reiterates its position that it does not have the financial resources to fix the damage that is being caused by some communities," Sambo said. Bushbuckridge police spokesperson Captain Donald Mabasa said no one was injured and that the cause of the fire was still unclear. "We are still not sure what caused the fire but we are still running an investigation."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
