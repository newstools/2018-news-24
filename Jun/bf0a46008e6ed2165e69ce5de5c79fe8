Teboho Setena The police in Bloemfontein are investigating the alleged rape of a 17-year-old girl, who has a learning disability. The incident reportedly occurred on 1 May. Sgt Sinah Mpakane, Free State police spokesperson, said a rape case has been opened for further investigation. Mpakane said a breakthrough was made with the arrest of the suspect, Thulani Sibiya (50), who reappeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on 20 May. “Further investigations into the alleged crime is underway. Samples were taken for DNA analysis as part of the investigation,” said Mpakane. She said the victim is enrolled at the Pholoho Special School in Bloemfontein, a school that caters for learners with learning disabilities. Mpakane said the incident reportedly happened in broad daylight at the victim’s place in the Caleb Motshabi location, one of the new residential settlements in Bloemfontein. She said the victim lives with her mother, who was absent when the incident occurred. “The suspect was arrested on 1 May, the same day of the alleged rape and shortly after an eyewitness identified him. “The witness reportedly caught the suspect in the act at about 10:00. “The witness was returning from a shop when she decided to make a turn at the victim’s place, only to discover the suspect, with his pants down, with the girl in the house,” said Mpakane. She said the suspect tried to flee the scene upon being caught off guard. “The witness alerted neighbours and members of the community. “A persistent chase ensued, ending up with the capture of the suspect by members of the community. “The police were called to arrest the suspect, who is reportedly an employee of the South African National Defence Force,” said Mpakane. He was released on bail of R1 000. Sibiya’s next appearance in court is set for Wednesday, 20 June. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
