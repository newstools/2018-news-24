during a baptism service in Ethiopia. Docho Eshete (45) was performing a ceremony in Lake Abaya
with approximately 80 worshippers when he was allegedly grabbed by the
crocodile on Sunday 3 June, reports BBC
News. "He baptised the
first person and he passed on to another one,” says Ketema Kairo, a local
resident. Borkena.com reports that the crocodile attacked Pastor
Eshete while his congregation watched on helplessly. The pastor, who was said
to have been bitten on his legs, back and hands, died from his injuries. Local fishermen reportedly used
fishing nets to keep the crocodile from dragging the pastor’s body further into
the lake. The church members are said to be devastated by the tragic incident. The crocodile is yet to be caught, reports Mirror
