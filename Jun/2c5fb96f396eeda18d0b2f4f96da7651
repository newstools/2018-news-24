City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said in a statement on Saturday that the damage at the substation was intense. Mashigo said the technicians had estimated that it would take at least two days to complete the repair work and fully restore the power supply. He said technicians managed to temporarily restore the power supply to parts of Monavoni by switching their supply to Raslouw substation. "It is unfortunate that the residents have to suffer as a result of these selfish and despicable acts. "We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused and wish to plead with the affected residents to allow the City’s technical team to conduct their work unhindered."
