A third escaped on foot and a manhunt was under way. Crisis Medical paramedics said on Thursday afternoon reports indicated that the 40-year-old father had been travelling with his daughter and son in the family vehicle when suspects attempted to hijack another motorist before setting their sights on his Volkswagen. A shot was reportedly fired from the front passenger side and hit the man. The children were not injured. Paramedics and a private security company found the man in his car. He had gunshot wounds to his left arm and chest, Crisis Medical spokesperson Kyle Van Reenen said at the time. After trying to save him for more than 45 minutes, the motorist was declared dead at the scene. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
