"I waited for my child for ten years and after just four months he was taken away from me,” she told YOU. She denied that the baby was sick when she took him to The Cow Jumped Over The Moon nursery school on Tuesday morning. "I'm being crucified. People say I'm a bad mother who took a sick child to school, but he was not sick,” said the woman, who asked not to be named. Police spokesperson Captain Nomsa Sekele previously told YOU that the child was ill when he was dropped off at school that morning, but later said it was not the case. An autopsy is being carried out to determine cause of death. The little boy’s grandfather told YOU he saw the baby on Monday, the night before he died. "Nothing was wrong with him," he said. The owner of the school has refused to comment on the incident.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
