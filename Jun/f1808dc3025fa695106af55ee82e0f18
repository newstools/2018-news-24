Thomas Ngobeni from Ka-Nwamakena, outside Giyani, was found dead in the bushes at the weekend.

The police in Namakgale, the Rhino 9 task team and the Phalaborwa community policing forum received a tip-off about the suspects from community members. Facing charges Ngoepe said the four men, aged between 27 and 42, were traced to the Namakgale policing area, outside Phalaborwa, where they were arrested in the early hours of Monday morning. He said one of the men was also linked to several violent crimes which included house and business robberies, farm attacks and murders. He had previously escaped from custody at Bushbuckridge police station in Mpumalanga.
