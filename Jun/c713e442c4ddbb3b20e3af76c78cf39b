plane? No, it’s Poncho the police dog to the rescue! The police department
in Madrid, Spain, set the internet abuzz when they shared a video of one of
their dogs performing CPR on an officer who’d pretended to faint. The clip, filmed during
a training session, has had more than two million views since it was first
shared on Twitter, Metro.com reports. Poncho took part in a first-aid
awareness demonstration for primary school kids held at police headquarters in
Madrid. In the video the eight-year-old cocker spaniel speeds to help the
policeman after he’d pretended to pass out. Poncho repeatedly jumps
on the policeman’s chest to “restart” his heart, then holds his face close to
the cop’s throat to check for breathing. The talented pooch
keeps performing CPR until the policeman “regains consciousness”. “It was a heroic
performance from Poncho, who didn’t hesitate in saving the life of an officer
with perfect CPR,” the Madrid police force said on social media. They added that while Poncho
isn’t used to perform CPR in real life it was a fun way to demonstrate to kids how
the procedure can save lives, 10tv.com reports. Poncho’s real job is to
sniff out explosives – he’s been trained to follow laser lights showing him where
to search. Watch the video here:  Sources: Mirror.uk, 10tv.com, Metro.com  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
