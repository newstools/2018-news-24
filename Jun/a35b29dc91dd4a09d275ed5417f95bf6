Mkosi’s resignation coincided with the implementation of a forensic report commissioned by the department of arts and culture into dodgy deals, extravagant business trips and staff unhappiness at the film development body. Concerned staff told City Press this week that there was relief that a clean-up was apparently under way almost a year after they wrote a detailed letter to the arts minister listing the allegations that would inform the investigation. They were concerned, however, that bosses implicated in the report would get away without punishment. However, Bokaba this week gave his assurance that action would be taken and transformation would happen at the foundation. “The National Film and Video Foundation is not at liberty to discuss ongoing disciplinary issues or ongoing internal investigations until those processes are finalised,” he said. “I can, however, confirm that criminal proceedings will be initiated where appropriate.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
