Watch.WATCH The Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipal workers called off their strike on Friday, GroundUp reports.

According to City Manager, Johann Mettler the settlement was reached that provides for “R10,000 for employees with 12 to 17 years, R16 000 for employees with 18 to 23 years, and R21 000 for those employees with service of 24 years and more”. The bonuses will be paid after Council approval which will come by 15 July at the latest. Mzwandile Toyise, a Samwu shop steward, told hundreds of workers gathered at the Feather Market that he was pleased the matter had been resolved. “We have achieved what we were demanding,” he said. Toyise said that Samwu had asked the Commission for Conciliation, Arbitration and Mediation to intervene and help broker a settlement, because the municipality had on several occasions refused the demands on bonuses. Worker Gloria Jacobs said, “Thanks to all workers who participated in the strike because the results are with us to enjoy. I am also appealing to workers that we should help each other in future. We need to unite and abolish the issue where departments fight their battles alone.” Most services in the metro came to a halt as the strike gained momentum and more unions joined it.
