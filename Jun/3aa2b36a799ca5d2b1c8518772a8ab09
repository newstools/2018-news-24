"Following this gruesome discovery, a manhunt for the suspect was launched… Subsequently, a 29-year-old nephew of the deceased was arrested [on Friday] night at the same village," said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. Ngoepe said the man was "positively linked to this incident" but did not say how. "The motive behind this murder is still unknown at this stage but domestic violence may not be ruled out." The body was discovered, stashed in a wheelbarrow in the toilet, on Tuesday following a tip-off from relatives. "The preliminary police investigations have recovered pieces of vehicle tyres which are believed to be some of the objects used to burn the deceased." The suspect would appear in the Moutse Magistrate’s Court on Monday on a charge of murder. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
