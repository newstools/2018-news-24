Fever Reporter A CONCERNED resident from Shayamoya in Kokstad expressed concern about service delivery after the Harry Gwala District Municipality did not assist him after a sewer blockage caused his home to flood with sewage recently. On May 30, the resident, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of victimisation, said a sewer blockage near his house caused sewage to spill into his home, flooding his entire living area floor. After shifting furniture, the resident said he contacted a Harry Gwala District Municipality senior manager responsible for water and sanitation from Kokstad as well as his local councillor, but was not helped. “I went to the mayor’s house, which is not far from where I stay, but his body guards turned me away and promised to pass on my message to the mayor, who would attend to the matter. However, I never received any help,” he said. “The problem was only attended to after I spoke to a municipal spokesperson from Harry Gwala District Municipality. “I am not trying to expose individuals but I want to raise concerns that we face as local people in relation to service delivery,” he added. Harry Gwala District Municipality spokesperson Ndabezitha Tenza confirmed that the concerned resident was helped after he spoke to him. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
