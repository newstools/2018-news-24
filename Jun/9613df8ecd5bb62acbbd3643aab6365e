The City of Johannesburg's group forensic and investigation services unit, the Johannesburg Metro Police Department and the Hawks arrested Irvine Steyn and Yvette Scheepers, who are employees at Waterfall Investment Company, on Wednesday. They were charged with fraud and corruption and later released on R5 000 bail after appearing in the Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Thursday. The pair allegedly colluded with Faisel Abrahams, a City of Johannesburg official who has also been released on bail after his appearance earlier this week. Willie Vos, CEO of Waterfall Management Company, said they were aware of the allegations against the developers and the City official. "Two Waterfall Management Company employees have been arrested but have since been released on unopposed bail. They have been granted leave and agreed to assist in the investigations," Vos said. "We take these allegations against employees extremely seriously and will fully cooperate with the authorities in their attempt to address the problem of corruption in South Africa." Vos said the company would take immediate corrective action in line with ethical business practices and legal requirements should anyone be found guilty of "untoward practice[s]". "As Waterfall Management Company is committed to full transparency, further announcements will be made once the investigations are concluded," he said.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
