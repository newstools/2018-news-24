JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the 39-year-old officer was granted bail after he was arrested on charges of culpable homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol. It is alleged that he was drunk and crashed into the rear end of another vehicle, which collided with a minibus taxi, killing three people, including a child. Lenasia police spokesperson Captain Hector Netshivhodza, said the case was postponed pending further investigations. "Investigations will continue and he will appear again [in the] Lenasia Magistrate's Court soon," Netshivhodza said. On Monday, Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Public Safety Michael Sun condemned the actions of the officer and said the City would not tolerate any of its officers being on the wrong side of the law. "I want to echo JMPD Chief of Police Mr David Tembe's message - that when one officer does wrong, that officer taints the reputation of the entire JMPD," Sun said. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Louw said the case was not placed on the roll for the officer's next appearance due to pending investigations in the case. She said witness statements of those who were also involved in the accident were yet to be obtained as all they had so far was "hearsay evidence". 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
