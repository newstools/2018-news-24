The man was seen by a neighbour on the roof of a house on Deepvale Road and when asked what he was doing there, he replied that he was fixing the roof. However, the suspicious neighbour called local authorities and the owner of the house. The man was found inside the house with some valuables bundled up in a blanket. Port Shepstone SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Zandra Wiid said the owner of the house told police that he hurried home from work after receiving a call from his neighbour that someone had broken into his house. “It was then established that a man was inside his house. The adult man was arrested and it was discovered that he had gained entry through the roof where some tiles were removed,” said Wiid. “There was also a hole in the ceiling and the alarm was cut. Some items were removed. The man will face a charge of house breaking and appear in court soon,” said Wiid. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
