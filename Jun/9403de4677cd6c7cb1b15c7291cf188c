Brigadier Jay Naicker said the public order police, the national intervention unit, tactical response team, flying squad, K9 unit and the Hawks raided Excelsior Court at about 02:00. They were searching for trespassers with the aim of rooting out any illegal activity taking place in the quarters, he said. "These police officers searched every room in the building and arrested 26 trespassers. Twenty-one of those arrested were not police officials and could not provide a reasonable explanation for being on the premises," he said in a statement. Naicker said all the arrested suspects were charged with trespassing and were each served with a R300 admission of guilt fine. "Police also made a discovery of 250g of heroin with an estimated street value of over R40 000 as well as 84 counterfeit DVDs. These items were found abandoned with nobody to account for them," said Naicker.
