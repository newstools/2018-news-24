When her mother, Kimberley Shultz, woke up a little after her daughter, she found Brianne lying in an overflowing bath. The young woman had apparently slipped while having a shower or fainted and ended up in the bath where her long hair seemingly had blocked the plughole, causing the water in the bath to dam up. The teenager from Butler, in the US state of Pennsylvania  who was crazy about her family, singing and painting  was described by friends as "someone who was always there for her friends and never put herself first”. Michael Rapp, Brianne's father, initially thought his daughter had run away when he received a frantic call from his ex-wife. “[Kimberley] was hysterical on the phone and she told me she was gone. I thought maybe she ran away or something. I didn’t realise she meant she passed away." He told CBS Local that Brianne was on medication for thyroid problems and that she’d often faint. But whether or not the condition lead to her death or she slipped and knocked her head is unclear. Brianne was a student at Butler Senior High School and was popular among her classmates. She’s survived by her parents, her brother, Tyler Rapp (12), and sister, Maddalyn Leitsch (4).
