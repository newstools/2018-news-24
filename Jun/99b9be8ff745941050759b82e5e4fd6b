On Tuesday, the man allegedly entered the shop pretending to be a buying customer. "The man approached the shop owner and threw curry powder substance in his eyes and fled with an undisclosed amount of money," police spokesperson Sergio Kock said. The suspect's secret ingredient was not enough to protect him from police and he was arrested at a hiking spot just outside Danielskuil mere hours after the robbery. He will be appearing in court on charges of business robbery soon.
