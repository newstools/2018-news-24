Appearing in court on Friday, Durant's attorney, Jacques van Heerden, asked the court for a postponement as Durant is set to have an operation on his shoulder later this month. EFF voice disapproval The postponement was agreed to by the State, as it was still awaiting the Director of Public Prosecutions' decision on whether or not it will prosecute Durant. The matter was postponed to August 30. EFF members clad in red voiced their disapproval, saying the process was taking too long. They then left the courtroom.

The magistrate declined the request.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
