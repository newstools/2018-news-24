The druglord, 34, rented the two-bedroom house that was raided, using it as a site to manufacture his drugs. R1 million worth of various forms of Nyaope and Rocks were seized, as were two firearms and ammunition. The four arrested will now appear before the Groblersdal Magistrate Court on Monday. They face charges of dealing and possession of drugs and possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
