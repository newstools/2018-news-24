Phiri shared is thoughts while speaking to the Fever during the Ramadan month. Muslims started fasting on May 17, and will conclude on June 15, with the aim of getting closer to God. “According to scientists, fasting makes better insulin sensitivity and lowers blood sugar levels. Fasting also brings unity and harnesses the spirit of giving,” said Phiri who is also a television presenter and producer on channel 347 (DSTV). During fasting, people abstain from eating food and drinking water from early morning till evening, and also stay away from unlawful activities. Phiri said that during fasting, people need to carry out the sprit of “ubuntu” by speaking good words and helping the needy. The holy Quran which contains amazing stories of Jesus, Abraham and Job was revealed during Ramadan month, according to Phiri. “Muslim communities pray a lot at night and day to harness their faith and almighty God.” Phiri condemned the terror incident which happened in Durban where Muslim followers were attacked inside the mosque recently. When Muslims conclude Ramadan month, they will hold several celebrations by praying and eating food. “People will be giving charities to the needy at the end of fasting month,” said Phiri. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
