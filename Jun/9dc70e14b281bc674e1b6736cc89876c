GCIS acting Director General Phumla Williams said Mashamba had served the people of Limpopo with "ethical and accountable leadership". "Government expresses its heartfelt condolence to the family, friends and relatives of the late MEC Mashamba, as well as the members of the Limpopo Provincial Legislature," Williams said. Mashamba, who was married to ANC stalwart George Mashamba, had been agriculture MEC since February 2018 and had held various portfolios in the Limpopo administration. She was the former MEC of Education, Safety, Security and Liaison; Sport, Arts and Culture; and Social Development in Limpopo. Mashamba was also a member of the Executive Committee on Social Development in the Limpopo legislature. On Wednesday, the ANC also extended its condolences to Mashamba's family. It said she had previously served as a member of the party's national executive committee. The South African Communist Party described her as one of the party's longest standing activists, and a central committee member. It said Mashamba had made important contribution to the overthrow of the apartheid regime. "Her commitment to economic and social justice, to the defeat of the exploitative regime of imperialism, was resolute. The SACP, our alliance and the working class are poorer without her," the SACP said.
