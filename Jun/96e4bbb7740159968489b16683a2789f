Earlier in the morning the minister in a Dutch Reformed Church, had presided over a communion. According to earlier reports father and son had died mysteriously but on Monday police confirmed to YOU that a 60-year-old man had shot his son, then himself, but said their names couldn’t be released as yet. Police were summoned to a house in Stilfontein at 2.45 pm on Sunday in connection with a shooting incident, North West police spokesperson Colonel Adéle Myburgh said. “A father in his 60s is believed to have shot his son, who was in his 30s, and then himself. We can’t announce the names of the victims because they haven’t been officially identified by the family,” she told YOU. Police are investigating a murder case. “At this stage the motive [for the incident] isn’t known at all,” Colonel Myburgh said. She declined to give further details, such as who’d called the police to the scene and whether there were other people in the house during the shooting. The church couldn’t be reached for comment. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
