Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut said police had responded to the threat and were investigating the incident. The targeted establishment is understood to have been Café Manhattan. Adam Spires, who had been meeting a friend for lunch at an adjacent eatery, told News24 that he had spoken to a Café Manhattan employee after noticing police tape around the establishment and sniffer dogs in the vicinity. The staff member told him that an email had been received from a "strange email domain". The email alleged that bombs had been planted around the area, "because they are breaking the Islamic code", Spires - a local vlogger - said. Café Manhattan on its website describes itself as "The Gay Spur" and the "oldest gay bar in Cape Town". News24 contacted Café Manhattan, which declined to comment on the incident.        24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
