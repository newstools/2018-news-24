Judge Mark Sher reminded double murder accused Vuyo Dondashe that a district surgeon had found him fit to stand trial, telling him he was "putting on an act" when he claimed he did not understand what was happening during his pre-trial hearing. This, after Dondashe's advocate Office Mtini also informed the court that his client was also not co-operative during consultations. "You must understand, if the trial runs and you don't co-operate, it will continue whether you co-operate or not," Sher told Dondashe. The case was postponed to August 17 for another pre-trial conference and to allow Mtini to take instructions from his client and prepare for trial. Dondashe has been charged with murdering his mother, Nolwazi Nongoma, 60, and twin sister Vuyokazi Dondashe, 22, in their one-roomed shack in Magatya Street, Lwandle, Strand on February 4, last year.
