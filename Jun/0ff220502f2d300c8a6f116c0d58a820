Fever Reporter A 60-YEAR-OLD man died during a boating incident in Shelly beach on Tuesday. According to NSRI Shelly Beach, the man appears to have been travelling with two other men on a motor boat when they were taken by a wave which caused one of the crew to be thrown out of the boat. “At about 8.15 am, NSRI Shelly Beach duty crew were activated by the Shelly Beach Control after a man fell out of a       boat exiting to go to sea through the surfline,” said station commander Jeremiah Jackson. “We believe bystanders were able to recover the man from the water while the casualty boat was able to turn around and go back to the beach shoreline,” said Jackson. He said several attempts were made to resuscitate the man using cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), however, he was declared dead on scene by paramedics. Also at the scene was KZN Private ambulance services, Hibiscus Med-evac ambulance services, Police Search and Rescue, the SA Police Services, Natal Sharks Board members, Shelly Beach Protection Services and Shelly Beach Control. “Condolences are conveyed to the family of the deceased man, his friends and the local boating community. “NSRI urge boaters, and anyone launching any kind of craft onto water, to wear life-jackets while their craft is on the water,” said Jackson. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
