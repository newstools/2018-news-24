total of 115 people, including police officers, have been arrested for
allegedly illegally occupying Durban police living quarters, KwaZulu-Natal
spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said on Saturday. "All the arrested suspects
were charged for trespassing and given a R300
fine. A further two dockets of corruption were opened after police established
that some people were renting out rooms in these buildings to other
occupants," Naicker said in a statement. He said police officers who were
meant to live in the building had rented their homes out and in some instances,
the rooms had been hijacked. Acting provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said, "It has become apparent over
some time that residences which were built to house our police officials have
been illegally accommodating people who do not work for the South African
Police Service. "This has resulted in these
buildings being in a state of dilapidation and not fit for human habitation.
The fact that people are on our police premises illegally also poses a risk to
the police officers that work from these places." Mkhwanazi due to the state that
the building was in, the police decided to undertake a cleanup operation at the living quarters at the Durban Central
Police Station. "In the early hours morning
on Friday, 15 June 2018 members from various units... conducted an operation in
both the male and female single quarters as well as the married quarters. "During the operation a large number of people were found
in these living quarters when they should not be there," said Mkhwanazi.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
