The commission's provincial manager Buang Jones made the announcement during a media briefing on Thursday at the hospital, following a walkabout of the radiation oncology ward. He said the inquiry would look into the impact the protests had on patients, and also find out whether the damage caused was "reasonably foreseeable and preventable".

The SAHRC visited the hospital for a site inspection, following several reports alleging there is a shortage of radiation oncologists in the hospital's oncology ward. The commission said it was also alleged there was a breakdown of vital cancer treatment machines and delays in the provision of healthcare services to approximately 500 cancer patients who are waiting for radiation treatment.
