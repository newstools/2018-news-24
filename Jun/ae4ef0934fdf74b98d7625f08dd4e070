The programme is called "Title Deed Friday" and will take place every Friday until September. Makhura - together with Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) and Human Settlements MEC Dikgang Uhuru Moiloa and Emfuleni Mayor Lehana Jacob Khawe - started the outreach on Wednesday. The provincial government took a decision to distribute the title deeds to beneficiaries by September 2018. One of the recipients was Malebakiso Thabedi, an elderly woman from Golden Gardens. Thabedi said she was very happy and, even if she died, "she would be happy to leave something for her children". Makhura urged communities to be vigilant against illegal land and house occupations, saying the government would not be giving title deeds to people who were not legal owners. "The handover of title deeds is an equally proud moment for the province. We have committed to bringing about redress by transferring ownership of properties to tenants who were denied property ownership previously," he said. Moiloa also urged residents to work with government, and be patient in waiting their turn to be recipients. He said the government was working tirelessly to ensure that all those who qualified would receive their houses. "Title deeds are very important. We will continue to work diligently to ensure that more residents receive their title deeds. Our commitment is to build a province where everyone has a sense of place and belonging," Moiloa said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
