Sassa employees affiliated to the Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) demand a 15% increase for junior positions and a 13% increase for senior positions. They also demanded the current housing allowance to be increased to R2 500, closure of Sassa offices for the period of Christmas and New Year in line with the leave policy, a minimum of three days special leave be granted for religious activities other than that of Christians, family responsibility leave and a danger allowance. The employees gathered outside the Sassa offices on Pietermaritz Street and, in the city centre, the employees were on a go slow. At the Northdale office, beneficiaries were turned away as the gates were closed due to strike. PSA provincial manager Claude Naicker said they [PSA] tabled the wage demand on February 1 at the Sassa National Bargaining Forum but Sassa failed to table any counter offer. The employees had given Sassa seven days to respond to their demands or they will continue with their strike until their demands are met. However, the strike was temporarily called off following a constructive consultation with the Minister of Social Development, Susan Shabangu, on Monday. Sassa spokesperson in Pietermaritzburg Mbizeni Mdlalose did not respond to the enquiries sent to him by the time of going to print. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
