Mzwanele Mkalipi SIVE MJIKELO says: “Being a youth in 2018 presents many opportunities and responsibilities as well. These days, there’s a lot that surround us and influences in the lives of young people. There’s a lot that youths can get involved in, like sport, education and fun, but it all depends on one’s choices. That which you get involved in may determine your future, whether it is negative or positive, so it is all up to you.” PHOTOS: MZWANELE MKALIPI Multimedia    ·   User Galleries   ·   News in Pictures

Scores of youths were injured and killed in the massacre.
