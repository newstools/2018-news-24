Siphelele Nketo FOLLOWING a Fever report on pit toilets used by pupils at St Faith’s Junior School in Umzimkhulu on May 25, the Department of Education has responded saying the matter is being attended to. Department of Education Harry Gwala district director Sindi Zakuza-Njakazi said the department is aware that pupils are still using pit toilets and that it is dangerous. Members of the Democratic Alliance (DA), including Dr Rishigen Viranna, the DA’s MPL in the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Legislature, visited St Faith’s Junior in Umzimkhulu, and Pholela High in Bulwer, as part of a school monitoring programme on May 21. Viranna said he was shocked after he was told that pupils were using unsafe pit toilets. He said that while at Pholela they also discovered old infrastructure, including malfunctioning computer labs. “There was an audit of all toilets from the beginning of 2018 in all district schools and the report has been submitted to the provincial government. The district has a plan in place to deal with pit toilets as they endanger pupils’ lives,” said Zakuza-Njakazi when responding about St Faith Junior. She added that the department is also aware of the state of buildings at Pholela High School. “The process of renovating the school has started and a scope of work has been completed. The department will start with minor renovations and will be awarding a tender for major renovations in September,” she said. Pholela was established in 1967 and has produced well-known people who have worked in government departments and private companies. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
