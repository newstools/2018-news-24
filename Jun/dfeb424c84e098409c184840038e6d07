Siphelele Nketo SEVERAL schools from the Harry Gwala District have been disrupted after service delivery protest erupted in three areas in Ixopo this week. People of KwaNokweja and Mazabekweni embarked on a service delivery protest these past two weeks, demanding water and the removal of their ward councillor from office. Similarly, people of KwaThathani took to the streets to demand running water. They barricaded the R56 road with burning tyres and rocks in demonstration. These were later removed for motorists. “We drink water with animals, which is harmful. We have been asking for water for many years but nothing is forthcoming from the municipality,” said a protester. In response to the protests, MEC of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Nomusa Dube-Ncube visited the area last week and asked disgruntled community members to stop their protest action, saying that government would be dealing with their challenges. She said government would be spending R 40 million in the implementation of the KwaNokweja Bulk Water Scheme, which was important for the community. Harry Gwala District Municipal spokesperson Ndabezitha Tenza said the municipality was aware of community frustrations and they were being attended to. “At KwaNokweja, water pumps are being upgraded to increase volumes of water for the entire community. “In the meantime, the municipality has provided water tanks to provide water to the people of KwaThathani village and KwaNokweja,” said Tenza. He called on people to allow children to go to school because their future depended on education. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
