Ngwenya, who spent almost five years on Robben Island during apartheid, faces a charge of crimen injuria after he called Titi a k****r in an SMS meant for Titi's business partner Aqueel Patel. TimesLive reported that Ngwenya had stormed into Titi's business premises and threatened to kill him and his business associates. "I got a protection order against him. I was told that he said: 'I will kill these dogs if they don't get my money‚'" Titi said. The protection order prohibited Ngwenya from making direct or indirect contact with Titi. Titi and Ngwenya had a friendship that dated back 20 years, but the relationship fell apart when a business deal went south. According to Ngwenya, Titi owes him almost R54m. The conflict ultimately resulted in Ngwenya calling Titi a "QwaQwa k****r" and a "bantustan boss" in an SMS.
