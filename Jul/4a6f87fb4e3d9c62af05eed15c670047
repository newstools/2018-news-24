Captain Tinyiko Mathebula said he was guarding the Department of Public Works building with his 28-year-old colleague in the early hours of Sunday. They had been sitting around the portable metal container, also known as an imbaula, that is filled with coals and a small fire to ward off the winter cold. A person from a building next door along Allen's Nek noticed that something was wrong with the men and called for help. The 43-year-old man had already died inside the building. His colleague was taken to the Flora Clinic nearby for medical attention. Honeydew police have opened an inquest into his colleague's death.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
