a lab in Durban on Wednesday evening. The KZN Drug Unit received a tip-off about drugs from
Tanzania that were apparently going to be "mixed, packaged and distributed"
across the province. The unit then went to a flat in Berea where a 36-year-old
man was found in possession of heroin, according to KZN police spokesperson
Captain Nqobile Gwala. "The heroin drug was found in a packet as well as
paracetamol tablets in a jar. The drugs were about to be mixed, packaged and
distributed to Durban areas," Captain Gwala told DRUM. "The total value of the recovered drugs is R600 000,
but once mixed the value will be R2 million." The investigation revealed that the makeshift drug lab is a
rented flat. The suspect, who can't be named until he appears in court,
is currently in police custody. He will appear in the Durban Magistrate's Court
on Friday. He is charged with manufacturing and dealing in drugs. See the pictures here:   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
