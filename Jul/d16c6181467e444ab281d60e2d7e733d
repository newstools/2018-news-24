Polish daredevil Andrzej Bargiel has become the first person to ski from the summit of K2 – the world’s second-highest mountain. After a gruelling climb to the top, Andrzej (30) descended the 8 611m from the peak in Pakistan yesterday. His brother Bartek filmed the descent using a drone. Andrzej has a long history of daring climbs and descents, according to the Daily Mail. In 2015 he was awarded the Polish Golden Cross of Merit for developing and promoting Polish skiers abroad and National Geographic Poland named him man of the year. His first attempt to ski down K2 was made last year but he had to call it off because of heavy snow and severe storms. But with great weather conditions yesterday, Andrzej was able to breeze down from the summit to base camp in just seven hours, CNN reports. Extra sources: Daily Mail, UNTV News, CNN
