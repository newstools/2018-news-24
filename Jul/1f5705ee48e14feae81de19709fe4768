Lieutenant-Colonel Dimakatso Mooi told News24 that chaos erupted when residents delivered their memorandum of demands at the municipal office. "Police had to fire rubber bullets when chaos erupted. No arrests have been made yet," Mooi said. Crowds of protesting residents marched through the streets over apparent service delivery issues and high tariffs. They are also calling for the heads of certain officials within the Sol Plaatje Municipality. According to ER24, three people were left injured following the protest action in Kimberley. "ER24 paramedics were alerted to the scene after receiving reports that three people had been injured by rocks during the protest action," spokesperson Russel Meiring said in a statement. "Once on scene, paramedics found that a man had sustained a wound to his head while a woman had sustained a fracture to her ankle." Meiring said both patients were treated and transported to Mediclinic Gariep for further treatment. "A third man was transported privately to a nearby hospital," he said. Scenes on social media showed community members marching through rubble-strewn streets while black smoke from burning tyres enveloped them. Police on the scene are keeping an eye on developments and are reportedly using tear gas and stun grenades, as well as rubber bullets, to disperse the crowds.
