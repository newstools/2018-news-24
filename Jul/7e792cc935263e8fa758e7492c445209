The court ruled that the decision was inconsistent with the Constitution. The decision to grant her diplomatic immunity was taken by former minister of international relations and cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane after Mugabe allegedly assaulted Gabriella Engels in a luxury hotel in Sandton in August last year. Rights group AfriForum and the DA challenged the decision by the department. Monday's decision comes as Zimbabweans vote in their first election since Grace's husband Robert was ousted last year.

Engels previously told News24 that should they be successful in challenging the decision to grant Mugabe diplomatic immunity, they would like to see criminal proceedings instituted against Mugabe.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
