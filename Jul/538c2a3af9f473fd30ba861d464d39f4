3 July) and the V&A Waterfront has marked the occasion with an installation
of a whale skeleton, made from eco-bricks. The installation looks to highlight the damage single use
plastic causes the environment. Shoppers will be able to swop their plastic shopping bags
for reusable V&A Waterfront bags – made from plastic bottles – at the
activation, until Monday 9 July. In addition, Pick n Pay announced that their flagship store
in the Waterfront will be running a pilot project to mark the international
awareness day. Shoppers at the store will have the option of purchasing
biodegradable bags, instead of the usual plastic ones, as well cardboard
carry-boxes.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
