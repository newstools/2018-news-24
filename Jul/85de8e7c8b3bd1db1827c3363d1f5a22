Present was one of four people arrested during a heist in Dobsonville, Soweto earlier this month. All four are charged with armed robbery and the possession of hijacked motor vehicles. The accused were arrested on July 6 and 7. Four hijacked vehicles were recovered, two of which were apparently used in a heist outside Capitec Bank in Elias Motsoaledi Road in Soweto earlier this month.

Last year, the Sunday Times reported that Present had been introduced to a top land reform department official at a land summit organised by former Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile Nkwinti. Eight months later, Bekendvlei farm in Limpopo was purchased for R97m and handed over to Present.

At the time, Nkwinti denied the allegations, however, the details of the deal emerged in a forensic investigation report conducted by Deloitte. The report apparently recommended that Nkwinti be charged for possible corruption. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
