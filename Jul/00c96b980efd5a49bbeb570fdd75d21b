SAPS spokesperson Captain Raphael Motloung confirmed the protest, saying that heavy objects and burning tyres were placed on the road between Matatiele and Maluti and the R 56 road between Matatiele and Mount Fletcher. Motloung said motorists from rural areas, including commuters, were disrupted and, due to this action, schools were unable to open. In September 2017, Route 56 Matatiele Forum marched for all border roads between Matatiele and Lesotho to be tarred. “Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle promised to intervene in our plight but up until today nothing has been done. “We even wrote letters to President Cyril Ramaphosa for intervention,” said Siyabulela Nkosana from the forum. Nkosana said the recent protest was not organised by the forum. MEC for Transport, Safety and Liaison Weziwe Tikana met the concerned community of Matatiele, promising that the roads would be revamped no later than this month. She said the T69 road will be refurbished as well as other roads. Following this, community members called off the protest, opening up the roads once more. Matatiele Local Municipality Mayor Momelezi Mbedla confirmed that nothing had been vandalised during the protests. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
