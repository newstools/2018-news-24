SOUTH African National Parks (SANParks) will be hosting the 13th annual SA National Parks Week from September 10-14. National Parks Focus Week is a worldwide campaign which gives people free access to national parks. SANParks chief executive officer Fundisile Mketeni said, “The week, in partnership with Total South Africa and FNB, is meant to cultivate a sense of pride in South Africa’s natural, cultural and historical heritage, protected by the national parks system.” The week gives day visitors free access to most of the 21 national parks, with special emphasis on ensuring that people from local communities close to parks get to know and experience a national park. The free access does not include accommodation facilities and other tourist activities. Some of the parks will be extending the week to include weekends. Individual park dates will be announced soon. SA National Parks Week has proved to be a successful campaign in terms of education and awareness of conservation issues and the various park offerings. “The survival of the national parks system and our natural and cultural heritage lies in the people of South Africa. Environmental education and protection is the responsibility of everyone,” concluded Mketeni. Don’t miss out on this annual event to experience South Africa’s beautiful natural heritage.
