Correspondent Cape Town has welcomed the arrival of four of its littlest new residents - who made an appearance when their mother delivered the quadruplets at Tygerberg Hospital, the facility said on Sunday. Two boys and two girls, each with their own paediatrician in the theatre, were delivered on Friday to a 22-year-old first-time mother from Khayelitsha, said the hospital's spokeswoman Laticia Piennar in a statement. “The mother and her 'quads' are in [a] very good condition and are doing extremely well." “A caesarean section (c-section) was performed at 29 weeks gestational age – a decision taken in the best interest of the mother and the unborn children,” explained Pienaar.
