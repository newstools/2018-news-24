Hailing from Cleland, Doubell and his fiancé Erika Kapp were setting up a water stand near Polly Shortts on the day of the marathon when he was run over by a bakkie on June 10. The driver of the bakkie then fled the scene leaving Doubell in critical condition and needing to be admitted to St Anne’s Hospital. Kapp told the Maritzburg Fever that her fiancé was transferred to Royal Hospital last Monday where he has undergone intensive physical therapy which will aid his lower limbs as he still cannot currently walk on his own. Kapp said that being in hospital for up to three weeks has placed a strain over Doubell leaving him in a dizzy spell but despite this he has been recovering well. “We really appreciate the support we have received from family and friends which has enabled us to cope well with the situation,” said Kapp. Kapp thanked everyone that had sent their well wishes, saying that it had helped to lift their         spirits and cope a little better with the situation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
