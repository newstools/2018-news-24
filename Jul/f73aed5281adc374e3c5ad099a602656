Jenna Etheridge The N3 highway in Pietermaritzburg towards Durban was blocked by trucks early on Wednesday morning due to protest action. According to traffic reports and social media posts, truck drivers shut down the freeway in a protest against fuel price increases. KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI) spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu told News24 that the blockage started in the early hours of the morning, around 04:00, on the N3 Durban-bound at the Church Street offramp, and stretched all way up to Town Hill. All lanes are said to blocked by trucks. Read:Â Protesters block Joburg N1 "It is not a truck protest. Residents around Pietermaritzburg are also joining (the) protest. It is the petrol price that they are moaning about," said Mngomezulu.   Commuters have been advised to make use of alternative routes and provide for extra travel time. There is congestion in and around the Liberty Midlands Mall and New England Road has been blocked. "We have been broadcasting this since early hours of the morning so it shouldn't be congested unless people are joining the strike. People should have used the R103 as an alternative route if they want to go to Durban or Johannesburg." Last month, two major national routes along the N3 at Van Reenen's Pass in KwaZulu-Natal and the N2 through the Western Cape town of George turned into no-go zones after it was blocked by protesters. A recent tweet issued by @TrafficSA reads: "My family has been stuck on the N3 since 5am this morning. Plus a 1 year old on board."  It is unclear when roads will be reopened. More to follow.
