William Thononda, 65, was gunned down by unknown men at about 08:30 at his home in Block F, said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "The motive for Thononda's murder is not clear at this stage, however, taxi violence may not be ruled out. The suspects are still unknown and there is no arrest," he said in a statement. Ngoepe said Thononda was parking a vehicle outside the gate of his house when a witness heard several gunshots. "Soon afterwards, a Toyota Yaris with Gauteng registration numbers was allegedly seen driving away from the crime scene at high speed," he said. Ngoepe said a manhunt has been launched for the suspects who shot Thononda. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba condemned the ongoing taxi violence in the province. "You cannot resolve conflicts by killing each other. These criminals are going to be hunted down and dealt with mercilessly and without compromise," said Ledwaba. Police urged anyone with information that can assist them in arresting the suspects involved in this case to contact Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501, Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or the nearest police station.
