However, EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi denied that it was a real firearm. The political party celebrated its 5th anniversary at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. The video shows the EFF singing and dancing on stage. During the song, Malema goes to the side of the stage and appears to fire several rounds from the rifle. He then hands it over to a man, who appears to be Bluff security company owner Adriaan Snyman, who then quickly ducks out of the camera's shot. Malema then gives a high five to EFF chairperson Dali Mpofu. When approached for comment, Ndlozi told News24: "It is not a firearm and no real bullets were shot. It was a simulation, part of our entire act of celebrating the 5th anniversary. It coincided with the singing of struggle songs and fireworks". When asked if he was present and took the rifle from Malema, Snyman told News24 that he was not aware of anything. "Phone me back in the morning," he said. Snyman has previously been identified as one of Malema's bodyguards. According to the Firearms Control Act, it is an offence to discharge a firearm, an antique firearm or an air gun in a built-up area or any public place, without good reason to do so.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
