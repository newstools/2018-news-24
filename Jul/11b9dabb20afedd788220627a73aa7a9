He made the remarks during a speech celebrating the political party’s 5th birthday in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape "Hey, there is a new capture here led by Patrice Motsepe," he alleged in front of a large crowd gathered at the Sisa Dukashe stadium. "We want to warn Patrice Motsepe – we are watching you, the same way we watched the Guptas: Stop doing what you are doing.  It is unacceptable," said the EFF founder. Malema added that while "we like you Patrice; you are our brother", nevertheless "greed is going to make us fight you and we are going to fight you very hard - because we know where your mines are and we are going to reclaim those mines". In particular, he warned that Motsepe’s ties to President Cyril Ramphosa and Energy Minister Jeff Radebe – who are married to Motsepe sisters - were dangerous. "South Africa did not elect Patrice Motsepe as president." Malema’s criticism for Ramphosa did not end there. He also alleged that Ramaphosa was "not in charge" of the country – instead Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and former finance minister Trevor Manuel were. They were planning on privatising state-owned enterprises, claimed Malema, adding that the EFF would not just ensure this never happened – it would also nationalise mines and banks.
