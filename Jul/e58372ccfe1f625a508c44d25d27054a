Method Stats SA said these estimates were produced using the "cohort-component method" for population estimation. In this method, a base population is estimated that is consistent with known demographic characteristics of the country. For the 2018 mid-year estimates, the cohort-component method is used within the Spectrum policy modelling system – a Windows-based system of integrated policy models. The estimate of the population includes South Africans and non-South Africans. The next census is in 2021. The last census was carried out in 2011.
