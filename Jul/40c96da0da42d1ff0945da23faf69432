In some instances, mothers along with uncles or other relatives of the 91 000 underage children had agreed on dowries for children as young as 14 years old, chairperson Lulama Nare said.

Nare said most child abductions where children as young as 13 were kidnapped to marry older men occurred during the December holidays. She said there was also no collaboration between organisations such as the commission and state authorities to deal with child abuse and rape. Police stations are acting as mediators and social workers when crimes are reported to them, Nare said.
