One of the suspect was later released. According to Verulam SAPS spokesperson Captain Henry Kisten, the five men were arrested at the Verulam CBD last week. “Constable Julian Ramroop was on duty performing visible policing duties in the CBD with other members when he was approached by a member of the public. The complainant said that his friend had withdrawn a large sum of cash from the bank. When he came out he noticed that he was being observed by occupants seated in two different vehicles. The vehicles were pointed out. Constable Ramroop and other members, together with officers from Reaction Unit South Africa, approached the suspects,” Kisten said. The police searched the suspects’ car and found two firearms, cellphones, balaclavas and implements allegedly used to break into vehicles. “The station commander Brigadier Victor Dludla commended the police for their quick reaction and on the arrest and recovery of the firearms.” The matter was adjourned for bail application in court. The four suspects were detained at the Verulam police cells until their appearance in court today, July 19. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
