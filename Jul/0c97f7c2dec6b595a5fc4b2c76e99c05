Phindile Shozi UPPER Highway parents, Thabisile Dlamini and Mxolisi Ngwenya are pleading with the community to assist them to find their 3-year-old daughter, Siphesihle Zamangwane Dlamini who went missing in December last year. According to the mom, the child was abducted after a church which she attended in the South Coast. Dlamini said she said that she was invited by a fellow church goer to a service in Port Shepstone and she took her daughter along with her. “It was on the 31 of December, 2017 when we went to church. The sermon was going well, my daughter was beside me and I went to the front to get blessed and when I got back to my seat I could not find her. I immediately ran out to look for her and she was nowhere to be seen,” explained Dlamini. “When we couldn’t find her we called the police. They looked and looked to no avail in finding my daughter to this day we haven’t found her,” added the distraught mother. The father said they opened the case for a missing person, and have put posters everywhere and even went to media platforms to try to find their daughter. “Despite all of the things that have been done, we still haven’t found her and it’s hard to cope everyday not knowing where our child is,” he said. Ngwenya pleaded with the community to help them in finding their daughter. “I appeal to anyone who might have any information on our little girl’s whereabouts to please contact us or the investigating officer as we will be entirely grateful. It doesn’t matter how little it is, to us it will be highly appreciated because we are so desperate to get Siphesihle back,” pleaded the father.
