technical glitches left many social grant beneficiaries in a financial
predicament after they couldn’t get their payments this week due to a problem
with their SA Post Office cards. Many of them depend on the grant to help with their basic
needs, and the delays caused by Sassa’s technical problems have hit them hard. Speaking to Drum, social grant beneficiary Sandra Mokoena
said that they haven’t received their money. “We just came from the post office. They’ve turned us
back…,” she said. “Some of us travel… you know from here to the post office
it’s a distance. Me, I’m even stronger, I can walk but what about these elderly
people who can’t walk.” (SASSA) has admitted
that they are experiencing a few problems but promised the system would be
working efficiently again soon. SASSA spokesperson Kgomotso Diseko told DRUM, “The old SASSA
cards are expiring at the end of September 2018 and we urging beneficiaries to
make use of the opportunity of visiting SASSA outlets”, He added that they work even on weekends in various regions
where beneficiaries could swap their old cards for new ones. However, the beneficiaries say the issue is far from being
resolved as post offices are threatening to go on a strike that would affect
them from getting their money. Watch the full video here:  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
