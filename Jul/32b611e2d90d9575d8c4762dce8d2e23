The Central Bank of eSwatini and the eSwatini National Arts and Culture Council were among the first organisations to heed the call, following the name change in April. According to a statement issued by the registrar of the former University of Swaziland (Uniswa), Salebona Simelane, the university will no longer be known as Uniswa, but the University of eSwatini (Uneswa). “It is advised that the pronouncement by His Majesty King Mswati III on the occasion of the 50-50 national celebration has led to an executive decision to change the name of the university to be in line with the pronouncement made by the king. “The name change is with immediate effect. Our new acronym will now be Uneswa, and all necessary changes which are in line with foregoing shall be communicated in due course,” read the statement in part. – Sibongakonkhe Nkosi 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
