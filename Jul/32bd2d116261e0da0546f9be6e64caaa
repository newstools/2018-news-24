is looking into a matter of alleged domestic violence, NPA spokesperson Phindi
Mjonondwane reportedly confirmed. This is after both Given and his wife Ipeleng
opened counter cases of assault on Saturday 14 July. They were both arrested. On Monday 16 July the pair dropped the charges and opted to
solve the matter out of court.  The NPA however, refused to drop the
charges and will have the final verdict. Ipeleng’s lawyer Mfana Gwala said, “There was an incident, a
domestic incident. After what happened on Saturday they sat and they spoke
about it and they decided to deal with the matter differently. That’s the
message they communicated to us and that’s the message we communicated to the
court and they indicated their intention to withdraw the matter and deal with
it differently.” The NPA ordered the police to investigate a previous alleged
case of domestic violence against Given by his wife Ipeleng. MSG Afrika Group has confirmed that Given has requested time
off to deal with the matter with his family. The group has expressed its stance
on the matter saying, “We affirm our commitment to the rule of law. MSG
strongly condemns domestic violence of any form,” read the statement.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
