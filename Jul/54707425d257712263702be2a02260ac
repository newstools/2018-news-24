Jenna Etheridge The mother of two girls who burnt to death after being left home alone in Colorado Park, Cape Town, was on Wednesday granted R500 bail in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said. NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said that it did not oppose Tashleema Brandt's bail application as there were no grounds to keep her in custody. The court postponed the bail application of her boyfriend, Cameron Adams, who is not the biological father of the girls, as it had to prioritise and finalise older applications on Wednesday.
