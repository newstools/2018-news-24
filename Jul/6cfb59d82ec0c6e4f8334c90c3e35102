In a bid to help spread some winter warmth, the SPCA Assisi in Jeffreys Bay is driving their first-ever Homeless Project campaign that will not only benefit those less fortunate, but also the town’s four-legged residents. “It is cold this winter and we have received a lot of inquiries from people who are in desperate need of clothing,” says Suzanne Kruger from the SPCA Assisi. “Shaun Aucamp suggested the Homeless Project campaign - supporting two causes at the same time.” How it works: residents buy a clothing voucher at the SPCA Assisi Jeffreys Bay Charity Shop in Jeffrey Street. The value of the voucher depends on the buyer’s decision. Secondly, residents must identify a worthy recipient and give the voucher to that person - whether it is a car guard, a homeless person or someone less fortunate. The recipient can then use the voucher to buy warm clothing or blankets at the charity shop. “The voucher cannot be exchanged for money, and the full amount of the voucher must be used - no change will be given,” says Kruger. The voucher is valid for three months. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
