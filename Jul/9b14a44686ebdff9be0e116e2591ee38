The girl, Angela Mrhasi, apparently accompanied her mother to fetch water at the dam, in the vicinity of Lower Mbhangcolo Village, said Captain Jackson Manatha. "She was found by a community member, already floating [in] the dam as the mother was still busy fetching the water." Residents tried to rescue Mrhasi, but it was in vain because she was already dead. Police warned parents to be vigilant and to leave minor children at home if possible when fetching water from dams and rivers. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
