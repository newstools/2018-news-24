"Both parties have agreed to a speedy disciplinary process, including a hearing that will take place over three days in August," deputy federal council chairperson Natasha Mazzone said in a statement. "In line with the agreement, the motion of no confidence [in] Mayor De Lille that was scheduled to take place today in the City of Cape Town council, has been withdrawn." In addition, the agreement would make space for De Lille to be held accountable in a fair and reasonable manner for findings of independent council led-investigations, such as the upcoming Bowman's report into her conduct, she continued.
