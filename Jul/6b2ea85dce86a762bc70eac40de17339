The event was free. Two netball and eight soccer teams, including Laphuma Ilanga Boxing Club, participated in the event. Sector Commander Captain William Fortuin said the event was very entertaining and informative. “We have worked with Mtotywa (the businessman) on many occasions. He is the pillar of the community­. “Working with him gives us a platform to talk to the community and educate them about various issues, including drugs and alcohol abuse and to also encourage the community for the prevention of domestic violence,” he said. Fortuin said the police welcomed anyone who wanted to work with them to alleviate crime in the community­. “We also encourage people to drink responsibly and stop neglecting their families,” he said. Mtotywa said their aim is to uplift the community and encourage the youth to stay away from wrong doing­. “We normally support people when they approach us for donations. We are working closely with the police to ensure that we guide the children,” he said. Mtotywa described their involvement in the community as a sign of giving back to the society. Siphosethu Njenjese (16), who plays for Future Stars Netball Club, said the event was entertaining. “We had fun and felt safe with the police around ... I wish the event can be a continuous thing and be well organised,” she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
