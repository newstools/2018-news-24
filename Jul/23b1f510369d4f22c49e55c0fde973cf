According to a GoFundMe started by her parents, 10-year-old Greenlee Marie was trying to rescue her two pet kittens from behind the family’s tumble dryer when she was electrocuted. New Boston authorities are currently investigating matters of how the incident occurred in the first place. Police Chief Garry McCrary told KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana that it's "too early right now to go ahead and place blame and responsibility until the investigation is over." Shelby Roos and Scott Hendrix – the mother and father of the little girl – had been renting the house for 15 months and say the tragedy occurred because of electrical problems, although authorities have yet to confirm if this was indeed the case. “[Greenlee] loved her babies. And she’d do anything for them,” Shelby Roos told the television station. “I know she’s up there right now with all of her babies.” “She was a compassionate soul and had more compassion in her at 10 years old than adults do in their entire lifetime.” “There’s no reason our baby should be gone. You don’t die inside your own home,” the distraught father added. Sources: People, KSLA-TV, GoFundMe 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
