Sibongile Mani's case was postponed to July 24, National Prosecuting Authority Eastern Cape spokesperson Tshepo Ndwalaza said. At her next appearance, the case could be transferred to a regional court. Mani, who is out on bail, blew around R810 000 of the money over about three months until the Walter Sisulu University got wind of it. She faces charges of theft and so far, is the only person charged. The university also considers her liable for any of the money she spent that was not due to her.
