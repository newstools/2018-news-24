communities. Some are conducted peacefully. Many are violent. Destruction of
property, theft and general lawlessness have marred some of the recent
protests.  Although service delivery protests happen almost weekly and have
become predictable, especially in towns where corruption is so rampant that
communities are seemingly left with no option but to protest, elected leaders
are unable to quell them. Some of the
leaders run for safety themselves. And some demand state-sponsored insurance to
safeguard their properties.  It is frustrating that not even the democratic process
that allows residents to vote out the corrupt officials is assisting in
bringing about stability. If a democracy can’t resolve tensions in communities,
it’s difficult to say what will. Most community concerns are valid. But the
tactics are not. The damage to public infrastructure adds to the service
delivery woes. It’s certainly not the solution.  The looting of shops belonging to both South African
business people and foreigners is another cause for concern. It is another
example of residents shooting themselves in the foot, because such conduct
could discourage retailers from investing in rural towns affected by such service
delivery protests. The result could be job losses and the loss of much needed
rates revenues for local municipalities. Communities must review the way they
fight for their demands. Or they risk being seen as being as bad as the corrupt
people they protest against.  Daan Bronkhorst
