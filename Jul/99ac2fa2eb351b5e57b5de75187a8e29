Christina Pitt Traffic on the N2 highway is flowing freely after a violent protest on the national road near Chesterville, Durban on Thursday. Metro police spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said shack dwellers took to the streets after their strictures were demolished, apparently by an unknown private security company, two days ago. "They threw debris into the road and a few cars were stoned. I'm also aware of a few vehicles which were set alight, but I can't confirm the exact number," he said. "We chased the protesters away and the N2 is now open. Police are still closely monitoring the scene." No injuries were reported.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
