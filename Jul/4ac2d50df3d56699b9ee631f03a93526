Watch.WATCH The Newcastle Regional Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man to 15 years in prison for having sex with a minor, sexual grooming and the possession of child pornography. He received 10 years for each count. The court suspended five years of each 10-year sentence for a period of five years, police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said in a statement on Wednesday. The man was arrested after police received a tip-off in January 2015 that a woman was in possession of nude pictures of children, Mbhele said. "During an investigation by Newcastle Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit detectives, it was discovered that she was taking nude pictures of two young females aged 9 and 10, sending them to her boyfriend." Mbhele said the man's house was searched, and hard drives containing child pornography images were found. Further investigation revealed that the accused also had sexual relations with a 14-year-old girl. In another case, the Durban Regional Court sentenced Jacques Rheeder, 35, and Tiaan Malan, 31, to five years in prison for being in possession of child pornography. Mbhele said Rheeder and Malan were arrested after child pornography images were found at their homes. "All the accused's names will be entered in the register of sexual offenders and [they] were declared unfit to work with children," Mbhele said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
