WATCH A brother and sister are expected to appear in the Jeppestown Magistrate's Court in Johannesburg on Friday for allegedly hijacking a property in 2013, Mayor Herman Mashaba said. The siblings were arrested at the property in Bezuidenhout Valley during a sting operation on Thursday night. They face charges of trespassing, housebreaking, contempt of court and contravening the Prevention of Illegal Eviction and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act. More charges could be added. Mashaba said, after occupying the property in May 2013, the pair apparently claimed it belonged to someone else and not the person they had been paying rent to. "The [siblings] have allegedly been subletting the property and have collected about R390 000 in monthly rental without permission from the owner," he said. "In August last year, [they] were evicted from the property but forcefully moved back after they threatened the security [who] was guarding the property." Mashaba said 26 hijacked properties have been handed back to their rightful owners and 20 alleged property hijackers arrested to date. The City, which audited some 500 "bad" buildings, confirmed that around 300 buildings were hijacked. Twenty-four of the 500 buildings belong to the City. "We are slowly winning the fight against property hijacking in the City. Criminals must know that they might run but there is no place for them to hide in Johannesburg," Mashaba said. "We are committed to ensuring that we stop the rot in our inner city and make it a prosperous and inclusive place for our people to live, work and play." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
