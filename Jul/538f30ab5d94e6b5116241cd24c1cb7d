According to GroundUp, about 21 toilets were donated by Amalooloo this week. Amalooloo co-ordinator Seka Mopeli said he saw a GroundUp article about the school in May and forwarded it to his seniors. They agreed to help. "I came to the school to check the condition myself. I was very sad when I saw the [pupils] in bushes relieving themselves. I also went to check the old toilets … They were so full … and built far from school premises," he said. Mopeli said they donated seven toilets for girls, seven for boys, three for female teachers and two for male teachers. He also said two more toilets were to be built on the sport grounds. School Governing Body member Nokuphumla Sithetha-Dywili said: "We thank Amalooloo … Our teachers are now going to be safe, and also the [pupils]." School principal Malixole Dliso said: "We are very happy and grateful to Amalooloo for what they have done for us … We have been crying for so many years about these old toilets but our cry was falling on deaf ears. It was when the story was published when we saw a reaction." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
