Thousands of residents in the eastern suburbs of Silver Lakes, Equestria and Faerie Glen were left without power after the facility burst into flames a week ago. On Tuesday morning, the municipality's Selby Bokaba said the city's teams of technicians and electricians had completed repairing the ring cable faults in Equestria, and were currently busy finalising the connection of cable networks that supply power to the area.

Bokaba said the main feeder cable from Wapadrand to Koedoeberg substations had also been repaired. He said they still needed to fix two cable faults in Faerie Glen and replace a feeder cable to Shere rural lines.
