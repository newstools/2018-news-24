it was carjacked has been found unharmed and has been reunited with her mom, the
BBC reports. Little Eliza O’Neill was strapped into her car seat in the back of her
mom’s Audi when the vehicle was stolen in Birmingham, England, on July 14 – without
the carjackers realising the infant was in the car. Her mom, Clare O’Neill, was driving when she was confronted by two
men who demanded to have the keys. They drove off with the car as she was
trying to get her child out of the vehicle, leaving her injured, Independent
reports. After a 45-minute police hunt Eliza was found unscathed at a local
health centre, unaware of the drama that had unfolded, Telegraph
reports. The infant was later taken to Heartlands Hospital where her mom was
being treated for her injuries. Says Clare’s neighbour Claudia Gardner, who took mom and daughter
flowers in hospital, “I’ve been told . . . they drove over her arm and dragged
her along the road.” According to West Midlands Police the carjackers are still on the
loose and in possession of the vehicle. It’s believed they were travelling
towards the town of Solihull. Police later released a picture of the mother and child and called for
members of the public to come forward if they had information on the
whereabouts of the criminals. “Great we’ve reunited mom and baby,” said chief constable David
Thompson. “If you know the idiots who did it, let us know.” Added detective inspector Jim Munro: “This incident’s shocked the
whole of our force area and we’ll leave no stone unturned in our search for the
offenders.” Sources: BBC, Independent,
