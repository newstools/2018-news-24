Siphelele Nketo AFTER feeling that their concerns were inappropriately addressed by government, residents of Mvenyane, outside Matatiele, say they will be meeting again to discuss how to ensure that government hears their voices. Last month, community members closed roads linking Mount Frere and Matatiele to protest a lack of service delivery in the area. A delegation from the Eastern Cape government visited the area to address these concerns on June 28. Complaints about the unfair election of ward committee members, who were elected in 2016, surfaced together with allegations of having no water and incomplete roads. People also complained about RDP houses built in the area, alleging that they were given to the wrong people. “Some of our concerns were not effectively addressed by government so we will be seeking another way to make government listen,” said a community member and a leader of the Community in Action forum Nonkululeko Munyu. The forum was established by community members to facilitate development in the area. Matatiele Local Municipality mayor Momelezi Mbedla previously told the Fever that some problems were experienced with the construction of the tar road in the area and promised that a new contractor will be appointed to complete the project. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
