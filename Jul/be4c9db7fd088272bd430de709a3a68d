Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the man who raped his 52-year-old mother on two occasions, in 2016 and 2015, was sentenced at the Verulam Magistrate's Court on Monday. He said the mother was having a bath in their Phoenix home, north of Durban, in 2015 when the first rape took place. "He approached her and informed her that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her whilst she was having a bath," Zwane said in a statement. He said she refused and was then raped. "He [the son] kicked the bathroom door. The accused then assaulted the victim and forcefully raped her. The victim reported the matter to relatives but when the accused was questioned he denied it," Zwane said. He said the second rape took place in 2016. "The victim was again alone with the accused at their homestead when he forcefully dragged and raped her. The victim reported the matter to the police and the accused was then arrested," Zwane said. He said when the victim was questioned in court, she said she feared for her life as the accused was a violent person. "He made several court appearances till he was convicted and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for rape," said Zwane.
