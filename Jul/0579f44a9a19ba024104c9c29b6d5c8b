LOCAL non-profit organisation Sistrs 4 Humanity has showed support to brave young Palestinian activist Janna Jihad (12). Janna is breaking international headlines for being the youngest registered journalist and press card holder at a media conference held at the St James on Venice Hotel in Durban on Monday. From the tender age of seven, Janna began recording videos of the injustices that were happening to her and her community, especially the children in the village of Nabi Saleh in Palestine. Janna is now also the ambassador of South African NPO 2 Suns Shamsaan an arts movement focused on global human rights issues and the promotion of arts and culture as a vehicle for social change. She is currently on tour in South Africa to raise awareness about the situation in Palestine. At the media conference, the brave young journalist said her plea to all South Africans is to give a voice to the voiceless, for the over 700 child prisoners held in Israeli prisons. Founder of local humanitarian organisation Sistrs 4 Humanity, Hassina Kathrada, rallied support for Janna and appealed to local communities to conscientise themselves about Palestine. “Janna’s cousin Ahed Tamimi and her mother Nariman Tamimi are facing an eight-month jail sentence for preventing soldiers from shooting children. These young feisty little heroes possess endless energy and zeal to liberate Palestine, said Kathrada. Janna said her dreams are currently prohibited by borders, but she will continue to dream of living in a free Palestine. “All your armies, all your tanks against a little girl holding a camera, in her smile we see the sun, in her eyes we see the courage,” said Janna. 2 Suns Shamsaan thanks Younus Moosa of Lucky’s Sports Centrefor his passion, participation and contribution to the press conference. Janna closed of the conference with the words of Nelson Mandela . “South Africa shall not be free until Palestine is free.”
