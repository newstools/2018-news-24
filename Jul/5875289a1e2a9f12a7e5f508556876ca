Police spokesperson Constable Matsobane Mabusela said that a large crowd blocked the roads while protesting for cleaner water. "I was there this morning and there were people gathered everywhere. From the information we have, the residents are complaining that they don’t like the water," he said. "No arrests have been made and we have not received any reports regarding property damage." Jubilee Hospital spokesperson Moses Tlamama said that the conflict had been resolved and that it was business as usual at the hospital. "The protest started around 08:00 and it really had nothing to do with the hospital. It’s just that the road was blocked at a certain point, so cars were unable to pass," he added.
