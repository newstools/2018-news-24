Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Ledwaba expressed his "disappointment [amid] the continuous acts of violent protest[s]" in the province and described the behaviour as unbecoming. This comes after six people, aged between 24 and 46, were arrested on Monday morning following violent protests in the area. "It is alleged that the communities of Kwarung and Bosehla villages in Malebogo area, under the Senwabarwana Policing precinct of the Seshego Cluster, went on rampage and started to block the roads [using] burning tyres and rubble," Ngoepe said. "The police were summoned, reacted swiftly and dispersed them." He said the protesters regrouped later on Monday and started throwing stones and looted shops. A number of items were stolen. "During the arrests, the stolen properties, which included electrical appliances, groceries and TVs were [allegedly] recovered in possession of the suspects," Ngoepe said. He said they would appear in court soon on charges of incitement to violence, theft, malicious damage to property and public violence. "More arrests are expected," he said and added that the Public Order Policing units were still monitoring the situation.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
