Forty-two-year-old Mpho Mokhethi was sentenced by the Clocolan Magistrate's Court on Tuesday, NPA regional spokesperson Phaladi Shuping said. Shuping added in a statement that Mokhethi was given 12 months for the violation of the grave, four years for the violation of the corpse and six months for the contravention of the Immigration Act. The six months was ordered to run concurrently with the 12-month sentence, he said. According to Shuping, the court heard that on May 26, 2017, a community member who had been visiting a graveyard, noticed that a grave had been opened. "The deceased's family was informed and they discovered that the grave had been partially opened and the lid of the coffin moved. "The police were called, and they discovered the head was missing. The family had to rebury the deceased with the head missing," he said. Shuping added that further investigation led officers to Mokhethi's house in Clocolan. He said officers dug the head out of the front of the man's house. Mokhethi admitted, in a plea agreement, that he had dug up the grave, opened the coffin and cut off the head, he said. "He put the head inside the plastic bag and took it home with the purpose of using it for his business to flourish.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
