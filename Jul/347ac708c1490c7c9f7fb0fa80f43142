Rapid response from police officials caused the attackers to escape empty handed.WATCH Fidelity Security guards have been attacked and robbed at a petrol station in Johannesburg on Tuesday afternoon, the company has confirmed. The number of guards involved is still unclear. "It was just a cross pavement [cash carrier] and it was not the cash van that was robbed. As they picked up money from inside of the [petrol station] store, the security guard was held up at gunpoint," Fidelity CEO Wahl Bartmann told News24. Bartmann said the incident took place at a Total garage in Douglasdale, Fourways. He said the robbers made off with a canister but added that "there was not big cash lost there". According to him, Fidelity's task team and police later arrested two people and recovered two canisters in Diepsloot. A firearm was also recovered, he said. The guards were not injured. Police could not immediately comment on the incident.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
