Western Cape police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut confirmed that a 23-year-old man was killed by an unknown gunman at 10:45. "The suspect fled the scene and he is yet to be arrested," he said. Mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services JP Smith said the man had been attending the clinic when the suspect entered the facility and shot at him. "The clinic is closed until further notice and clients were advised to attend facilities in neighbouring areas, while the Mitchells Plain Community Health Centre was contacted to manage all sick children," he said. "The City debriefed staff immediately after the incident. This will be followed by trauma counselling and support to staff members." Mitchells Plain Community Police Forum chairperson Abe Isaacs expressed dismay that the murder had taken place in a health facility. He said it was unclear if the shooting was gang-related. Gang tensions have recently flared up in Beacon Valley, Eastridge and Tafelsig, and an urgent plan to deal with the "genocide on the Cape Flats", which he described as a "silent civil war", needed to be formulated by the police, Isaacs insisted. *An earlier version of this article stated that the shooting had taken place at the Mitchells Plain Day Hospital, as stated by the police. The City of Cape Town has since confirmed that it took place at the neighbouring clinic, which is a municipal facility.
