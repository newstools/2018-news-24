IT was all joy and smiles for Zwide United RFC’s management and players when the National Lottery Commission (NLC) handed over kit and equipment to them at Wolfson Stadium on Friday. Speaking to PE Express, the chuffed Zwide United RFC life president, Freddie Makoki, stated that they had applied for the grant of R150 000. Makoki said, “When the NLC confirmed that our application had been approved, the entire club was very elated. Our club does not have financial muscle. We have to dig deep into our pockets to run our club which has four teams which are a senior team, reserve side, second team and ladies’ team. We are now relieved because our burden has been lifted by the NLC. “We have used all the funds in buying the playing kits, tracksuits, kitbags, warm kits, golf shirts, and equipment like whistles, scrum machine, water bottles, stop watches and many more. “Our players are so motivated because NLC has lifted the spirit of our players. I would like to thank NLC for coming to the rescue of the club of the poorest of the poor.” NLC monitoring and evaluating officer Mzoli Vango advised that Zwide United RFC should apply for another grant again after a year. He added that a cooling off period for the recipients was a year. “The only thing that clubs must do is to give us a report that shows how they used our funds in the form of receipts,” said Vango.
