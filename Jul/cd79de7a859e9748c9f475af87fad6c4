behind a string of cash-in-transit heists was arrested in Bloemfontein on
Thursday night and is currently in custody in Mpumalanga. Wellington “Bibi” Cenenda has been a wanted man for his
alleged links to over a dozen cash-in-transit heists, including an attack on
two cash vans in Boksburg last month. Cenenda is believed to be part of the group that was in
involved in a shootout with the SAPS while allegedly planning a heist. One suspect died in the shootout. Along with the reported links to the heist, Hawks spokesperson
Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi says the suspect was also detained due to his alleged
connections to a 2016 murder in Kriel, Mpumalanga. “In 2016 he did not attend the court case in Kriel. He ran
away. However, with the help of the TRT (Tactical Response Team), he’s now in
custody in Mpumalanga,” Mulaudzi said. Cenenda has reportedly been on the run for nearly two years
and investigations are ongoing to find out what involvement he has in the spate
of cash-in-transit heists across the country. He’ll make his first court appearance on Monday 20 August. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
