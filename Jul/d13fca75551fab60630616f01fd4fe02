News24 previously reported that Adams struggled with addiction to the drug tik and had allegedly stolen his mother's cellphone the night before the incident. She believed he had taken it to a nearby drug house as he told her he needed R30 to get it back. Adams' mother, Eleanor, told News24 that Adams and his girlfriend had left in the early hours of the morning to go and retrieve the stolen goods, despite Eleanor telling her son not to leave as she was exhausted and didn't trust herself to stay awake. Western Cape police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said the cause of the fire was being investigated.
