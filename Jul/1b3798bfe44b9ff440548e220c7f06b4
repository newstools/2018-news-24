Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement that the attacker had been identified as 23-year-old Nur Arawal from Somalia. Arawal was an outpatient at Bellville's Karl Bremer psychiatric hospital from 2013 until recently, Mulaudzi said. Arawal was shot dead by police officers following the attack. "The motive for the attack is not yet established but there are no links to suggest any involvement of extremists or radical activity. Arawal's remains have been handed over to the family for repatriation and burial."

He died after a confrontation with the police. The attack came at the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and five weeks after another attack at a mosque in Verulam, KwaZulu-Natal.
