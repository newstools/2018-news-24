Unathi Obose Police have arrested six suspects for trespassing and two men died after they fell through a roof they were trying to strip bare at Kwa-Faku Primary School in Lower Crossroads last month. Philippi East police station communications officer Captain Bheki Xulu said the school security night guards first heard a noise, and on investigation, saw about five men standing outside the entrance to the school. The guards said the men wanted their way in but were denied access. “They jumped over the fence to steal the school building material. Later two men, between the ages of 21 and 26, fell from the roof of the school and were declared dead on the scene after they fractured their necks and spines,” said Xulu. The six suspects will appear in court next Wednesday. Sydney John, deputy principal, declined to comment and referred all questions to the provincial education department. Jessica Shelver, a spokesperson at the department, confirmed the incident and said an investigation into the matter is currently underway. “We can’t comment any further until the investigation has been concluded,” said Shelver. Ward 35 councillor Mboniswa Chitha also confirmed the incident and decried the escalation of crime in the area. “I’ve heard about the incident and as residents we are very concerned about the crime rate in the area. “As a community, together with City of Cape Town officials, we agreed to demolish all the unoccupied shacks in Marikana informal settlement­. “We have requested the Marikana community leaders to assist us in identifying them because we hear that the criminals rob or steal and then use Marikana as a hiding place,” said Chitha, but added he will confirm the date for their operation with the City officials. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
