She said the first device was discovered just after 22:00 on Saturday under a vehicle parked in Marriot Road. The second device was found at 23:30 under a vehicle located at Avondale and Milner road. Explosive unit members were sent to the scene to determine what type of devices had been used. Some reports indicated that the explosives were found in the parking lot of the Greyville Race Course – where the Durban July took place on Saturday. However, Gwala confirmed that this was not the case. No arrests have been made yet but investigations continue. The discovery of the latest explosive devices comes after a suspicious device was found in a Woolworths store at the Gateway Mall, also in Durban, earlier on Saturday. Previously, in the week, similar devices were found at the same retail chain, one in Gateway and one at the Pavilion Shopping Centre. The device on Saturday, which appeared to be a cellphone attached to a pipe, did not explode. On Thursday, clothing caught fire at the same shop in Gateway where a similar device was found. Officials were investigating if the device caused the fire.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
