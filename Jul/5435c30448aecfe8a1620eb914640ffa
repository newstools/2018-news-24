Siphelele Nketo A NUMBER of community protests were seen in the Harry Gwala District recently, with residents demanding access to clean running water, roads, health facilities and electricity. In response, the municipality has asked residents to calm down as their grievances are being attended to. “The municipality had problems with ageing infrastructure, burst pipes and illegal connections, which hinder the smooth flow of water. Water tanks have been utilised to mitigate the problem of the water shortage,” said Harry Gwala District Municipal spokesperson Ndabezitha Tenza. Areas that were affected by the community protests last month included KwaNokweja, Mazabekweni, Gugwini and KwaThathani. Tenza said water tanks supplied to KwaNokweja were turned away by the people, although they were protesting for water and roads. He said that on July 31, water will be operating in KwaNokweja and he asked people to allow the water tanks to deliver water in the meantime. “Water tankers were delivered in Jolivet, Nkwezela, Hlokozi, Mazabekweni, Ufafa, Gugwini, Mariathal, KwaThathani and Mahlabashane village. The tanks are filled by municipal trucks every day,” said Tenza. Last week, residents of Horseshoe and Mphela of Kokstad could be seen walking with empty buckets as they searched for water after the taps went dry. A number of containers were standing next to the dry taps while residents washed their laundry in the Umzintlava River. Tenza told the Fever that water could not flow easily to the reservoirs because of blockages in the pipes, which resulted in people not getting water. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
