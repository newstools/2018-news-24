The five-year-old was reportedly last seen playing at her grandmother's home in Khayelitsha until about 18:00, spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said. "The child left for home, but she never arrived. The community started searching for her and her clothes were found near a shack, where her body was found shortly after," she confirmed. The girl had stab wounds to her chest. Rwexana said a preliminary investigation led to the arrest of a 33-year-old man in the Harare settlement. The man is expected to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court once he has been charged. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
