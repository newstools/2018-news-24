Colin Hendricks A child died after allegedly being catapulted more than 3 metres into the air when a jumping castle "exploded" on a packed beach in Norfolk, England. The girl, who hasn’t been named, suffered a heart attack when she was thrown in the air at Gorleston Beach, The Telegraph reports. She’d been playing on the trampoline in a section of the beach called Bounce About, which also has an inflatable slide, traditional trampolines and a rodeo ride. The girl, believed to be no older than four, was taken to James Paget Hospital where she died. Witnesses said they heard a loud bang and saw the child being "catapulted" into the air. A man gave her cardiopulmonary resuscitation until an ambulance arrived.

The temperature was about 23°C that day. "It’s very upsetting," Johnson said, as quoted in Daily Mail. "We’ve been at the beach for a very long time, definitely a number of years, and it’s the first accident we’ve had there. It’s quite shocking." A witness, Kayla-Ann Weaver, who was sitting just a few metres from where the incident took place, said she’d never let her girls play on a jumping castle, The Sun reports. "My thoughts are with the little girl’s family," she added. A joint investigation between the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities and police has been launched into the circumstances around the incident.
