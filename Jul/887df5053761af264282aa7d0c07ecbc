The accused, Aubrey Goemeone Seitsang, Sibonile Sobopha, Herbert Baxesi, William Nyenyane, Samson Gqwetani, Mzoli Gift Luvela, Luvo Soyizwaphi and Mzolisi Mbulane, were each handed 20 years' imprisonment by the North West High Court in Mogwase on Wednesday. In a statement, the Hawks said Sabata was murdered on December 8, 2016, by a group of men who hacked him with pangas following a dispute over the allocation of RDP houses. "The North West Hawks' priority violent crimes (unit) investigated the case and arrested fourteen suspects in connection with the murder," said Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi. "Charges were withdrawn against six of the suspects and the remaining eight accused were found guilty of murder." Lebeya said it could never be business as usual when people take the law into their own hands regardless of what their grievances are about. "The authority of the state will be applied without fear or favour at all times. This sentence is testament to the collaborative efforts by the prosecuting and investigative teams. We hope the sentence will discourage lawlessness in all its forms," said Lebeya. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
