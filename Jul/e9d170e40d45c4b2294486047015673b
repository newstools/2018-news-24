WATCH The City of Tshwane says it will meet with residents of Hammanskraal to attend to their demands after they brought the town to a standstill on Tuesday and Wednesday in a protest believed to be over the quality of water. Mayor Solly Msimanga said he had decided to meet with the residents' forum on Friday, July 13, to further discuss issues contained in its memorandum. Residents reportedly burned tyres and blocked roads in Temba during the protest on Tuesday. Police had to disperse the crowds who also brought Jubilee Mall to a standstill by blocking its entrances. READ: Hammanskraal service delivery protest blocks access to hospital Msimanga said the City had received a memorandum on May 16 from the aggrieved residents. He said the memorandum had a deadline of 21 days. "Due to the nature of the demands, the City had to have extensive engagements with the relevant service delivery departments within the City of Tshwane in order to respond and provide accurate feedback on the issues raised, and therefore the 21 days deadline could not be met," he said. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Kay Makhubela said five people were arrested for public violence and malicious damage to property after residents pelted passing cars with stones. He added that police continued to monitor the situation. All blocked roads have since been re-opened. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
