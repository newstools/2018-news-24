Phumzile Ngqayimbana, 46, and Siyamcela Ntshitshi, 37, were sentenced in the Mthatha Magistrate's Court on Monday. The two were also sentenced to six years for the unlawful possession of firearms and three years for the unlawful possession of ammunition – which were ordered to be served concurrently. The men were found guilty after they plotted to kill Dukumbana for instituting a disciplinary hearing against one of them. "It is understood that Ngqayimbana claimed he was targeted by Dukumbana, as he failed to act in a theft which occurred at Spar. The crime was reported by the supermarket's security guard," Provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Anelisa Feni said in May. Dukumbana, who was killed in December 2013, had just returned from work when two men appeared behind her and opened fire on her, killing her instantly. It was believed that residents had spotted two unidentified men fleeing the scene on foot, moments after the shots rang out. A third accused Mbuyiseli Ngqayimbana, had been acquitted of all charges. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
