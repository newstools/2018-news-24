Some of the issues discussed at the conference include the abuse of women and children, recognition of women in communities, crime, and community support programmes and women empowerment. Young women who attended came from Mount Frere, Bizana, Matatiele, Kokstad and Mount Fletcher. The attending women sang and prayed for peace in societies. “We hosted the conference to educate young women on how to end domestic violence and fight child abuse. “Young women who are single mothers often get abused in their societies and we want that to come to end,” said Thabile Mbhele, the leader of young women from the church. Reverend Mduduzi Mbhele, from the Mount Currie Circuit 114, said women need to be more empowered in their communities and churches. “We want women to work hand in hand with communities to fight child and women abuse, crime and help victims of abuse,” said the Reverend. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
