An elderly man is healing well after he was stung by a swarm of an estimated 1 000 bees. Tom Mizell (81) from Tarkington, Texas in the US, told The Cleveland Advocate he was farming on his property when he saw "a black cloud of bees". "I was running a bulldozer in the woods, helping my cousin clear a right-of-way for a fence. All of a sudden I saw a black cloud of bees surrounding me," he said. "I jumped off the dozer, which happened to be in neutral. I left it running and took off through the woods, trying to make my way to a little lake I'd dug on the property." Tom, who's known in his community for his roadside vegetable stand, was alone on the farm during his harrowing ordeal and didn't have a cellphone with him so he couldn't call his daughter, Tresh Holt, for help, she told Fox26. "He didn't know where they came from," she said. "The bees just attacked him." The old man fumbled and ran as fast as he could to the pond about 180m away and jumped in as the bees continued their attack, Fox26 reports. "I walk by faith and not by sight," Tom said. "I could hardly see. The bees had got in my eyes and ears." His wife of 57 years, Mary, and their son, Joey, weren't at home during the attack. They'd planned to meet up with Tom at midday that day, but Mary said her instinct told her something was wrong so they decided to return home sooner. "I just had a feeling," she said. "I said, 'Something's wrong with Papa. I think we should check on him.'" The farmer was in terrible pain when he was rushed to Cleveland Emergency Hospital, where doctors and nurses immediately started removing the stingers from his body. On his head alone they found 135 stings. Tresh said doctors told the family that if her brother and mom hadn't gotten to Tom when they did, he probably wouldn't be alive today.
