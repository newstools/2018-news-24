Igshaan Hendricks, Nishaat Wessels and Rashaad September appeared on a murder charge via audio visual remand from Pollsmoor Prison, where they are in custody. Hendricks – who was a tenant in murdered Bradley Fredericks' home – previously indicated he would appoint his own attorney. On Monday, however, he opted for legal aid, as did his co-accused.

Hendricks lived with his wife and two children in a bedroom in Fredericks' home. They had apparently been long-time friends. Fredericks was reported missing three days before he was found by a search party, buried in a bushy area in Harmony Village. Fredericks had a string tied tightly around his neck and was lying in a deep grave covered with a plank. His remains had partially decomposed.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
