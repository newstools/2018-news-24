"The girlfriend, a Tshwane Metro Police Officer, is alleged to have been storing the weapons that were used during the attack of two CIT vehicles in Boksburg." A rifle, magazine and several rounds of ammunition were recovered, and a Toyota Quantum, which was believed to be a cash purchase, was confiscated. Naidoo said that the metro cop's boyfriend is believed to be linked to several cash-in-transit robberies in the country.
