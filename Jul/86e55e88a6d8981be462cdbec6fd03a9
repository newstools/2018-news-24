The SAPS in Limpopo released a statement saying, “The provincial commissioner in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Nneke Jim Ledwaba, is still reeling with shock and disbelief at the brutal manner in which the three children were killed. [He] has condemned the re-occurring incidents of domestic-related killings and attacks which are still taking place in some areas in the province in the strongest terms.” After accusing his wife of infidelity, the 43-year-old Manyi Village man chased her with a sharp object in the early hours of 28 July, but she managed to get away to find help. While she was gone the man went to where the three boys – identified as Tshilidzi (7), Thabo (6) and Olugaho Madou (2) – were sleeping and brutally killed them. “The motive behind this incident is still subject to the ongoing police investigations but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. The police have opened cases of of murder which are still being investigated. The suspect will appear in the Dzanani magistrate court soon,” Ledwaba said. He also stressed that, “Members of the community who are having social problems must consult their local relevant authorities for intervention rather than taking the lives of others – especially vulnerable groups.” 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
