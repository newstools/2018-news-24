The conference, which was meant to take place last month in Empangeni, was derailed when disgruntled branches filed an interdict application in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg at the last minute. The same court ruled that the results of the November 2015 elective conference were unlawful, and the provincial executive committee led by Sihle Zikalala was swiftly disbanded in 2017.

"We engaged on different issues that were a stumbling block to the progress of the movement. The issues were resolved to pave the way for the conference.

Five key leadership positions are now up for grabs in the troubled province.
