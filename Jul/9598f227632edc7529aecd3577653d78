Tawanda Mbira, 25, was sentenced after pleading guilty on Friday. "We hope this sentence will scare away would-be offenders from committing the same crime," Captain Xoli Mbele said in a statement.

He was apprehended after he dropped the bag and ran away. Police officers chased him down and arrested him. Police discovered an explosive Carmex connector, capped fuses and a detonating cord in the plastic bag. The court also declared Mbira unfit to possess a firearm. During the course of the trial, Mbira was denied bail and remained in police custody until he was convicted. Mbele said Mbira's conviction was a result of "diligent work done by an investigating officer".   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
