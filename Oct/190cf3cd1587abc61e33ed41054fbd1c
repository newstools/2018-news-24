Consul General of the United States Sherry Sykes was accompanied by Dr. Albertina Luthuli, the daughter of Albert Luthuli, and Museums Council Chairperson Important Mkhize in unveiling the memorial bench, which was built by the U.S Consulate in memory of the late struggle icon. The unveiling of the bench started off with dialogue session titled: “The role of the youth in continuing the legacy of Senator Robert F Kennedy and Chief Albert Luthuli” that took place after an informative keynote address by Sykes. This event follows another visit to the museum by U.S Consulate in June where the U.S. Consulate and Luthuli Museum were joined by Albertina Luthuli to commemorate the meeting between Robert Kennedy and Albert Luthuli in 1966, where the two struggle heroes discussed the liberation struggle. At the June event, family members, students, and Groutville residents gathered and a tree was planted in commemoration of the historic meeting. The meeting between Kennedy and Luthuli took place just a year before Luthuli’s mysterious death in 1967.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
