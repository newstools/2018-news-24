The discovery followed a three-day search by the KwaDukuza Municipality lifeguards and the IPSS Medical Rescue team which had to be called off several times due to bad weather. According to Paul Herbst of IPSS Medical Rescue, the body washed up approximately two kilometres north of Zinkwazi Beach, approximately 20 kilometres from the drowning site. “We received calls from KwaDukuza lifeguards stationed at Zinkwazi that a member of the public had spotted the body approximately a kilometre north of Zinkwazi Ski Boat Club. “The body was handed over to the local SAPS,” he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
