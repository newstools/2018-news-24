The Steenberg Community Policing Forum (CPF) has condemned
the murder of a 92-year-old woman in Lakeview yesterday (30 October). Steenberg police spokesperson Constable Wesley Twigg says:
“At about 16:40 the body of a 92-year-old woman was discovered at an address in
Chad Road. The deceased was found with her legs and hands tied together with a
scarf in her mouth and a head wound. A case of murder was opened for investigation.
Suspects are unknown and yet to be arrested. Anyone with any information about
this incident is requested to contact Steenberg police on 021 702 9000 or Crime
Stop on 08600 10111.” CPF chairperson Gavin Walbrugh says it is “very unfortunate
and sad that something like this had to happen”. “I don’t have much detail on
this incident but I can confirm that there was murder of an elderly citizen in
Lakeview. It appears to be a burglary and she was the elder in the house, which
she shares with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. However, I’m still
waiting for more information and clarity on the case,” he says.
