The police in Vrede are investigating the murder of Philemon Ngwenya (53), one of the intended beneficiaries in the corrupt Vrede Dairy Farm Project. Sgt Mmako Mophiring, spokesperson, said the battered body of the deceased was found on Thursday (18/10) in his shack at Knelvlei Farm with some wounds on the head. He said a passer-by informed the deceased’s family, who then reported it to the police at around 20:30. “The motive for the killing is not yet known,” said Mophiring. Particia Kopane, the DA’s premier candidate, has reacted with dismay to Ngwenya’s killing. “Should the motive be linked to the project it will not be the first time a person loses his life while trying to expose the rot in this project. Moses Tshake, an auditor in the Free State Department of Agriculture, was kidnapped, tortured and killed after allegedly questioning payments to the Vrede Dairy Farm Project in 2013,” she said.
