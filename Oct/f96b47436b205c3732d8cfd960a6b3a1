Kessie Nair has been charged with six counts of crimen injuria and two of incitement of public violence for the use of the word in the viral video. At his last court appearance in September, Nair took the opportunity to apologise to Ramaphosa via the media present. "I'd like to take this opportunity to publicly apologise to the state president, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, and to the nation as a whole. I'm not a racist," he said. "The remarks I made on the video which I posted, there could have been different alternatives that I could have utilised, but using the k-word obviously brought about the emotional aspect. "I would call upon the president and the nation to find it within them to forgive me."

"It will be a futile exercise to continue with the bail application, despite the affidavits from the accused's family," prosecutor San Bhartu said. She submitted that the court needed to be guided by expert evidence on whether Nair was fit to follow court proceedings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
