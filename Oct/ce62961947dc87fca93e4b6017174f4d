Officers had gone to his home in Venus Way, Matroosfontein, on Saturday evening after receiving a complaint, said Captain FC van Wyk. They found the 52-year-old man's lifeless body. Die Son identified the man as Leon Jacobs. It reported that Jacobs, who had been a volunteer since 1990, was apparently stabbed 10 times. "The deceased's sister informed [police] that his Golf 7 was missing," said Van Wyk. Police recovered the vehicle in Delft and arrested a man. Another man was arrested on a murder charge. The pair, aged 29 and 31, appeared in the Goodwood Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear when they would appear in court again.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
