Canny Maphanga A nurse, who used to work at Mediclinic through an agency, has faced the wrath of social media users after she took to Facebook to shame Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso's alleged rape victims. The nurse, who was identified as Ivy Masuku in the Facebook post, ridiculed Omotoso's alleged rape victims in an exchange with fellow Facebook user Nompumelelo Sithole. The post has since gained notoriety on social media, with users on Twitter calling on Mediclinic to discipline Masuku. However, the clinic confirmed to News24 on Wednesday that she stopped working at the hospital some time ago, despite her Facebook profile indicating that she worked at Mediclinic Muelmed in Pretoria.

In a status originally written in isiZulu, Sithole said: "These girls whore around quietly and now they are acting like they have been raped? Some of them still exchange their bodies for cash… he should have sexually assaulted them more." Masuku in turn, agreed with the sentiments. "They must not annoy us," Masuku responded. Cheryl Zondi, the first witness in the trial, has been giving graphic testimony in the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth this week. Zondi described how she was allegedly sexually groomed into committing lewd acts for the pastor from the age of 14. The trial continues on Monday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
