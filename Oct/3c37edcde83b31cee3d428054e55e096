The fire, which started after 02:00, razed 30 wood and iron structures, said divisional commander Edward Bosch. It took five hours to bring the fire at Salamander Road, Hangberg, under control. He said 48 firefighters battled the blaze with eight fire engines and three water tankers. Two people of unknown gender or age were killed, said Bosch. A man and a woman sustained third-degree burns, while another woman suffered smoke inhalation and was treated at the scene. Damping down efforts are still under way. Bosch said the cause of the fire was not known at this stage.       24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
