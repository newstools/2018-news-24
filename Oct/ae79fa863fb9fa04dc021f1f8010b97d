"Moyo was a long-standing Sanef council member who was deeply passionate and committed to strengthening media freedom, promoting ethical journalism and defending the public's right to know," Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Mahlase said in a statement on Friday. Moyo, 40, died on Thursday night following a short illness. Moyo was known for his much-admired community newspaper Inner City Gazette that reported on various social issues affecting the inner city of Johannesburg. "With his charming smile and quiet demeanour, Moses had an unparalleled passion for covering community news and putting issues that directly affect communities at the forefront," Mahlase said. "He had recently expanded his business, the popular Inner City Gazette, to cover the Tshwane metro area and he was looking forward to further growing the paper," she added. 'Moses' legacy will live on' The seasoned journalist formed part of Sanef's newly formed subcommittee on community media at the time of his death. "The journalism fraternity has lost a committed comrade but we are certain Moses' legacy will live on," Mahlase said. Tributes have poured in for the journalist who dedicated his work to bettering the lives of Johannesburg workers and residents. Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has also expressed his condolences to Moyo's loved ones. Former editor-in-chief of EyeWitness News Katy Katopodis expressed shock at the passing of Moyo.
