IFP leader in the National Council of Provinces Mntomuhle Khawula said that he would miss Nyawuza’s parent-like advice and wisdom which helped develop younger party members. Khawula said this while IFP members visited Nyawuza’s home in Oslo beach. Dr. Nyawuza died at Port Shepstone Provincial Hospital on Tuesday morning after a short illness. He had served the IFP as its National Council Member and was also a former member of the Ugu district municipality from 2006 to 2016. “I have known Faku [Dr. Nyawuza’s clan name] for over 30 years and learned a lot under his guidance. To me he was a father figure who imparted many lessons,” said Khawula. Nyawuza faithfully served in various committees, such as the local Government and Traditional Affairs committee in the Ugu district, after 1994. Khawula recalled how Nyawuza took him under his wing when Ugu municipality lost through floor crossing. Nyawuza, who was known for his passion for the IFP, served in numerous committees under different mayors, such as Sithembiso Cele and Ntombifikile Gumede of the African National Congress. He was forced to retire in 2016 because of ill health, but continued attending party gatherings. Funeral details are expected to be announced soon. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
