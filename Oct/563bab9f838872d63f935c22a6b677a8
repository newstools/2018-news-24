SEPTEMBER is Police Safety Month and, in commemoration, the Hillcrest SAPS held a march on Wednesday, September 19, from the corner of Old Main and Inanda Road and ending at the intersection of Old Main and Stonewall Road. Hillcrest SAPS communications officer Captain Linzi Smith explained that each police station is encouraged to commemorate the month with an event that promotes police safety. “With the alarming rate of police members being killed in the line of duty, we have decided to do this march to create better awareness,” said the captain. Police walked through the streets holding up a banner with the words “Stop killing our police” on it, this to create awareness that police officers are also human and can feel pain like any other person. “To emphasise that enough is enough, we had our handprints and signatures on the banner and also pleaded with the community to please work with us in fighting crime,” said Smith. While marching, the police also handed out pamphlets to members of the community with information they might use when in need of assistance. Smith said that they are blessed with the amazing support from the Upper Highway community, saying: “They are truly wonderful, kind, caring and generous. “We just want them to know that we are here for them, even though we all face numerous challenges, we as police officials try hard with what we have at hand and we are grateful to the community for always supporting us,” she concluded.
