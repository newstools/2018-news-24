THE Kumari Veloshani Manicum Dance Academy will be jetting off to India’s International Groovefest, which will be held in Dubai next month. The academy will be representing team South Africa at this prestigious dance competition. Teams from around the world submitted video clips for the initial audition, which was the first stage of the competition, and only 200 contestants were selected from around the world. The academy was selected in the semi-classical category, which will comprise Bharathanatyam and various other art forms. The team consists of Kumari Veloshani Manicum, Maxine Murugan, Divenita Govender, and Valentia Pillay. This team is set to showcase their talent at the Hartland Auditorium, based in Dubai, sharing the stage with other dancers from around the world. The academy said in a statement: “As the youth of the community, we have achieved this through hard work and dedication. We step into this event as team South Africa with the hope that this opens the door to other international opportunities to our fellow dance academies within South Africa.” — Supplied.
