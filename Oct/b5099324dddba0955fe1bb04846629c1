A letter was distributed, headed "Notice of illegal distribution of matric final examinations". However, the Department of Basic Education distanced itself from it. "While the so-called circular has our logo, it has no address, contact details or the name of the author. It is clearly designed to cause confusion," spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said in a statement. Mhlanga added that the department viewed the letter "in a very serious light".

The department also pointed out that there were no supplementary examinations in 2019 but that there would be a full exam in May and June. "With that said, we call upon our [pupils] and teachers alike to continue to demonstrate commitment and good conduct as the examinations continue," Mhlanga said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
