Riaan Grobler A video has surfaced of former president Jacob Zuma animatedly "conducting" his Cabinet as a choir. Filmed before the official Cabinet photograph was taken, most likely in 2016, Zuma leads the Cabinet in the singing of Masenz' Amathamsanqa (Give us blessings), a choral piece by Tozama Matshikia. In dramatic fashion, Zuma acts as the choirmaster, waving his arms in the air, slightly off-beat to the singing.
