THE Friends of Kloof Library are hosting a talk on Lt Colonel Mike Hoare on Thursday September 27. Lt. Colonel Mike Hoare became a household name in South Africa, Rhodesia, and Zambia in the 1960s and famous throughout the western world for crushing the bloody Simba communist rebellion in the Congo. He headed five Commando, a strike force of 300 mercenaries who he dubbed the Wild Geese and who, amongst other missions, were pivotal in the rescue of surviving hostages from the Stanleyville massacre in 1964. In 1981, Hoare became infamous when his attempt to overthrow the government of the Seychelles failed, and he and all his men were jailed. Hoare was, in fact, an adventurer first and foremost, and Africa was his playground. Known as an officer and a gentleman, he was cultured and well read. Over the years he wrote five books about his many and varied experiences. His son, Chris, is a journalist who has spent 12 years meticulously researching the abundance of information about his father’s life and has produced a fascinating biography of a man of an extraordinary time which has long passed. Chris will speak to us about his biography, Mad Mike Hoare — The Legend, which promises to be an exciting and informative account of a true “legend” of Africa. The book will be on sale for R350. Tickets are R35 for friends and R50 for the public. Please book at the Library 031 764 7543 and pay at the door. — Supplied.
