Patrick Mabindisa, Luzuko Memani, Simthembile Stephens, Tembela Mahlatshana and Baxolele Mtengi appeared before Magistrate MAF Mafanga. She postponed the matter to November 9 for further investigation. They were arrested on Tuesday for defying a court order. Their lawyer pleaded with the court to reduce the bail amount to R500, stating that they could not afford it. "All of them are dependent on their spouses," she said. Mafanga said R1 000 was reasonable considering that the bail had been initially set at R2 000 by the court. A large group of MyCiTi strikers gathered outside the Cape Town Civic Centre, while another group attended the court hearing.
