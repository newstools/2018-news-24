Ugu District Municipality Mayor This week, Ugu District Municipalityâ€™s extended management team is embarking on an annual Municipal Service Week Programme where all managers have been deployed to conduct ground level work with the aim to get a holistic perspective of the different sections of the organisation and improve service delivery. Municipal Service Week is imperative as all employees of the organisation at all levels need to speak the same language, that of improved service delivery. The tasking of management to engage in this service delivery improvement initiative, amongst other objectives, is to develop a culture of collective responsibility for a better functioning municipality. As a municipality we cannot tolerate mediocrity. We strive to once again become the best district municipality in the province, if not in the country, and that can only be achieved if all employees work together and find solutions to the identified service delivery challenges. The critical areas that were identified, amongst others, were the Vacuum Tanker Services, Meter Reading, Billing Section, Customer Care Relations, and Enquiries. These areas, by a larger percentage, are in touch with the communities and as the municipality we saw it befitting that management gets first-hand experience on the operations of these sections to get a different perspective on challenges and short, medium, and long-term solutions thereafter. The municipality promotes working together to create an environment that is friendly, responsive, accountable, effective, and efficient for local communities. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
