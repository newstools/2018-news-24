The passenger train accident, which left 320 commuters injured on Thursday evening, occurred when one train rear-ended another train that was faulty and stationary at Van Riebeeck Park Station in Kempton Park. Gauteng Metrorail Spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng confirmed in a statement that 32 of the 320 injured commuters suffered serious but not critical injuries. No fatalities were recorded. "The Metrorail train crews of both sets are also getting medical attention," said Mofokeng.

Mofokeng said there would be an investigation to determine the cause of the accident and that the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa would be working closely with other authorities. "Metrorail technical teams will be working around the clock to recover the site. The cost of the accident is still unknown at this stage." "Metrorail would like thank commuters for their support and understanding during this difficult time and sincerely apologises for the inconvenience caused," Mofokeng concluded. Following the accident, the United National Transport Union (UNTU) has called on Transport Minister Blade Nzimande to intervene and suspend the services of Metrorail. "UNTU warned that passenger trains are death trains and that the situation is life threatening. The Minister, the Railway Safety Regulator and Prasa ignored us," said UNTU spokesperson Sonja Carstens. UNTU said the Metrorail services should be suspended until the rail operator can provide a safe and reliable service.
