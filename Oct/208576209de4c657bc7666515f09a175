The website has a portal that allows people to search for jobs and learn about new skills and enterprise development initiatives. The party said the website would provide easy access to its online broadcasting platform, 1912. News24 previously reported that the ANC's original website was shut down because the party allegedly owed its service provider, Unwembi Communications, R32m.

The settlement figure amounted to almost R3.7m. The party said it has since advised its legal team to attend to the matter because it viewed it as a "deliberate attempt to cast doubt" on its reputation after the service provider put up a notice that the site was closed due to non-payment. "Our legal team [has] written to SA domain demanding the return of our domain which we deem to be a property of the African National Congress and that no private company should attempt to lay claim on the inheritance on the people of this country," it said. The party said processes were under way including the investigation of possibilities of opening an extortion case against the service provider. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
