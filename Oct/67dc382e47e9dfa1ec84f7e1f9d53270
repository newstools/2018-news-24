The SABC on Friday said it noted "with concern" a WhatsApp message doing the rounds warning members of the public, particularly in the Weltevreden area, west of Johannesburg, about would-be robbers posing as SABC TV licence agents. "The SABC wishes to inform the public that it has not appointed inspectors or officials for purposes of physical inspections of television sets from households. "Any person that claims to be an SABC official or agent in order to gain access to a house or premises must be reported to police as they do not represent the SABC," the public broadcaster warned.
