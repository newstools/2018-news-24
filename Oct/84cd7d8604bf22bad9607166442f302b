ONE girl’s dream of playing netball in the national squad is set to become a reality as the 16-year-old was selected to join the U18 national netball squad when the team plays in New Zealand in May next year. However, in order to live out her dream, she is required to pay R35 000 for the trip. Refilue Nketsa, from Shayamoya Township in Kokstad, started playing netball when she was still a little girl. She played for the Shayamoya Secondary School netball team and was selected as a goal keeper for the national squad at the Confederation of Southern Africa School Sport Association (Cosassa) games in Lesotho last year. “In July, I was representing the Free State Provincial Netball Team at the provincial games and I was lucky to be selected for the national squad. “I am asking sponsors to support my dream, and so that I do not to miss this opportunity,” said Refilue. Refilue is now in Grade 11 at Hoërskool Sentraal, Bloemfontein, having received a scholarship to attend the school. Her manager and trainer, Berbeto Mnikina, called for businesses to support Refilue, saying: “Refilue never disappoints when she is playing and her trip is depending on her financial support.” Secretary of the South African Schools Netball (SASN) Ronelle Nell said Refilue is humble when playing and SASN is proud of her potential. “She (Refilue) is one of best netballers and we don’t want to lose her,” she said. She confirmed that netballers need to pay a total of R35 000 for the trip.
