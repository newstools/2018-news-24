Mbhele-Dlamini, who is also a constable at the Hillcrest Police Station, revealed that what inspired her to start this academy was a combination of her love for modelling as well as the heartache of seeing children throwing away their lives into drugs and alcohol. “In my line of work I deal with children too and I thought to myself: ‘What can I do to help them because it’s really heartbreaking seeing how they are wasting their precious talents like that’,” she said. After giving much thought to what she could do, Mbhele started the academy, where she’s helped a lot of children turn their lives around. “I’m hoping to help even more children achieve what they want in life in spite of what has happened in their lives.” The academy accommodates every child who wishes to pursue a career in music, modelling and acting. “My main focus with the academy is to teach the children discipline,” said Mbhele-Dlamini. In conclusion, she welcomes all children to join her academy. “Every one is welcome despite of the colour of your skin, race, and size because we are trying to build a nation of confident future leaders,” she said. Those who want to join the academy can contact Andile Mbhele-Dlamini at 083 894 2310. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
