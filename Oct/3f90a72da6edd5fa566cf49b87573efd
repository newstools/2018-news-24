THE Nelson Mandela Bay side campaigning in the ABC Motsepe League, Sibanye FC, received a heroes’ welcome in their home town despite their 2-1 loss to Tornado FC during their Nedbank Cup provincial semi-final at North End Stadium in East London on Saturday. The games were scheduled to be played at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane, but according to SAFA Eastern Cape provincial executive officer, Isaac Klaas, the Buffalo City Municipality reserved the venue for Chippa United’s game that will be played on Saturday, October 20. Klaas said the Bay side gave a good account of themselves. He stated that Sibanye FC did not show any respect to the ABC Motsepe League defending champions. “The Bay lads played as if they were playing on their home turf. Sibanye FC gave Tornado FC a run for their money. Their game was enthralling and it was a game of two halves, but at the end of the day there had to be a winner. Be that as it may, the Bay side ‘wore their socks off’.” However, since their first season, Sibanye FC showed that they were a formidable side. The arrival of Bruce July at Sibanye FC also kept the spirit of the Port Elizabeth side high. Their never-say-die attitude makes Sibanye FC a most respected side, whether they play at home or away. Their home supporters gave Sibanye FC a heroes’ welcome because they did not disappoint the Nelson Mandela Bay region. In another semi-final the hot favourites, Amavarara FC, suffered a huge 3-0 defeat to Mthatha Bucks. Tornado FC showed that it was not a fluke when they won the ABC Motsepe League title in 2017/2018 season after they devastated Mthatha Bucks 2-0 in the provincial finals.
