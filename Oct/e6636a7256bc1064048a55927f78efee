POPUP is a registered non-profit organisation situated at Piet Retief Primary School in Sidwell and operates as a fully-fledged skills training and development centre. POPUP NMB opened their doors in April 2017. “Our vision is to transform lives and uplift individuals to impact their world. We firmly believe that transformation takes place from a holistic point of view,” said Louise van Heerden, general manager and visionary leader of POPUP NMB. POPUP provides services to Nelson Mandela Bay residents who are between the ages of 18 and 45, unemployed and with no access to tertiary education. These individuals should be able to read, write and speak English. Learners start with a compulsory seven-week life skills programme before moving to three-month adult education and training programme (AET) to help learners reach a functional level in English and mathematics. Thereafter, learners move on to any one of a variety of skills offered. The next life skills programme will start on October 15 at 08:30. POPUP will do a compulsory assessment on October 11 at 09:00 to help them place learners in the correct AET programme. To register, learners must bring R100, a copy of their ID and a copy of their highest qualification/grade passed. The registration fee includes all stationery, books and a meal every day. Learners can register Monday to Thursday from 08:30 to 13:00 at Piet Retief Primary School, 174 Sutton Road.
