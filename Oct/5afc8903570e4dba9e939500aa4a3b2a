YOU Digital Staff at a bank in Nanning, China, were shocked when a snake dropped into their staff meeting. The 1,5m python fell through the ceiling of the bank, landing directly between two employees who were at the meeting, Independent UK reports.    CCTV footage shows the bank clerks first recoil in surprise then flee in all directions as the reptile slithers away between a set of chairs. The staff called security and workers from a nearby wildlife park soon arrived at the scene. The non-venomous snake was captured and handed over to the region’s Wildlife Rescue Research and Epidemic Monitoring Centre, according to ABC. Conservationists said it’s possible the snake was an escaped pet looking for food when it fell into the bank.  Fortunately, the snake didn’t fall on any of the employees and no one was injured during the terrifying moment.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
