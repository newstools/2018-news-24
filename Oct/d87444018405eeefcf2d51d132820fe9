"We have established a joint team with the provincial detectives and IPID (the Independent Police Investigative Directorate) to investigate the matter. We will know in due course as to what exactly happened," Gauteng Hawks head, Major General Prince Mokotedi, said. "The DPCI member and the other victim of the shooting sustained serious injuries and we were not able to interview them." The Hawks member was driving a BMW X1 along the M1 highway when he was shot and injured. According to Gauteng Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu, who spoke to News24, the man was not on duty at the time of the incident. She said details surrounding the incident were still sketchy and that an attempted murder case had been registered with the SA Police Service. "I understand he is in critical condition and we can't reveal his name...," Mulamu said. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo told News24 that there were still no new details related to the investigation and that no arrests had been made.  He added that the victims were in a critical condition in hospital. Earlier, Masondo said five suspects had opened fire on the man, who had been travelling in a BMW X1 with a passenger, believed to be a woman. An eyewitness, who spoke to News24 on condition of anonymity, said the suspects opened the boot of the vehicle and removed what looked like a bag. They then fled the scene. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
