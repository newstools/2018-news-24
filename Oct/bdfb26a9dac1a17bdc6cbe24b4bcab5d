Spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala would only say that the investigation was continuing when she was asked about the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Imthiyaz Khan and Megesh Naidoo, who owned One Stop Towing, were shot outside a service station in Ridge Road by the unknown occupants of a Toyota Etios, which had tinted windows. Gwala said the incident took place at about 01:40. She said Khan and Naidoo were two of five men who stood outside the service station. "The occupants in the Etios fired randomly at them. One died at the scene [and] four were taken to hospital for medical attention, where one later died," Gwala added. She said three men were wounded.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
