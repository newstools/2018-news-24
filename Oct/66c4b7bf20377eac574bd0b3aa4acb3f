shoulder after it was shot by its owner's neighbour on Monday night. It is alleged that the neighbour shot the dog because the
Staffordshire Bull Terrier-cross had apparently tried to bite the neighbour. Pietermaritzburg SPCA field officer Thobile Gumede said she
was summoned to Comet Place informal settlement in Northdale, and when she
arrived she "saw the dog lying in a pool of blood on the floor". Gumede said: "The owners and community had tried to
bandage the dog's wound while they waited for me to arrive but it did not
really help stop the bleeding. The dog wasn't crying or growling. It was awake
and just lying there. It was in shock." The male dog, named Skhebereshe (B**ch), was taken to the
Hilton Vet, where X-rays confirmed it had been shot. "Luckily, the bullet only pierced the skin and did not
hit any organs or break any bones," said Gumede. She took Skhebereshe to the Pietermaritzburg SPCA clinic
where it is expected to make a full recovery. The owner, who asked not to be named, said he had called the
police and opened a case of animal cruelty against his neighbour. Gumede said it appeared that the cases of animal cruelty in
the city are increasing.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
