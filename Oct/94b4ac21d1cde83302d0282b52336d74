The motorist reported the three female officers after they stopped him for driving towards oncoming traffic. "Instead of issuing a fine, the three officers allegedly demanded money from the motorist," said a statement from the Tshwane metro police communication unit. "The motorist alleges that he gave them the money and took down their vehicle registration as they left. He then went to the TMPD offices to report the incident where he was immediately assisted."
