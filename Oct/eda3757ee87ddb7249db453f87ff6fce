37-year-old woman was watching the protest action outside the Pretoria
courthouse from a distance. Though she
was raped more than 25 years ago, it still haunts her – and that’s why she came
to court today, she tells YOU. Liandi gets teary-eyed when she talks about her
own rape as well as that of the little girl at the Dros restaurant in Pretoria. “It’s
something that never leaves you. You can never forget. Or forgive,” says
Liandi, a mother of one. She was too
anxious to go into the court building. “I feel I
want to slice him into pieces and hurt him as much as possible,” she says,
wringing her hands. The
suspect, 20-year-old Nicholas Ninow, appeared in court today in relation with
the rape of a seven-year-old girl last week in the restroom of a Dros
restaurant in Pretoria. He showed
little emotion when he stood in the dock of courtroom 17 in the magistrate’s
court in Pretoria. At first he stood tall, his shoulders squared. But when
journalists started taking pictures, he quickly tried to hide his face. Liandi
tells us she was 12 years old when she was raped in a public park while on her
way to netball practice. “The man
had been in his thirties and to this day I’m paranoid about my own
[11-year-old] daughter’s safety.” She says
she hopes by attending the trial she’ll find closure for her own trauma. “I hope if
the court sees how angry people are, he’ll get a heavier sentence,” she says.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
