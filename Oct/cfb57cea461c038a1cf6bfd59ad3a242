The case was postponed to January 24 for pre-trial where Zuma faces two charges of culpable homicide and a count of negligent driving. The businessman, 34, is facing charges of culpable homicide relating to an accident in February 2014, when Zuma crashed into a taxi after losing control of his Porsche on the Grayston Drive off-ramp on the M1 north of Johannesburg, News24 earlier reported. In July 2014, the State withdrew charges due to "insufficient evidence", but later decided to reinstate the charges after lobby group AfriForum announced its intention to privately prosecute Zuma.

The case was previously postponed in August to allow the defence time to study the docket and prior to that, was also postponed in July for the disclosure of inquest proceedings and the content of the docket.
