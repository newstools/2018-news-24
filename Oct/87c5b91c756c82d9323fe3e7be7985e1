As such, the Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma Local Municipality initiated a plan to engage with local farmers who are land owners to provide land for the benefit of farm communities. The municipality faces challenges relating to the building of RDP houses and delivering basic services like water and electricity because of private ownership of land. Municipal deputy mayor Philani Shange held a meeting with some local farmers last Thursday and farmers showed an interest in giving out land to the municipality. Speaking to the Fever about the meeting, Shange said a portion of land in the Underberg area was provided to the municipality to build RDP houses. He said the municipality will send land surveyors to assess the land before building houses for farm communities. He said public views, along with those from farming communities,will also be taken into consideration with regards to the services they need. “The municipality has provided a portion of land for burials after farm communities complained about a lack of land. Farm communities have been living in difficult conditions for a long time; now the municipality is taking a step forward to better their lives,” he said. Most areas in Bulwer and Creighton have better services because the land is under traditional ownership. Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma Municipality communications Sikhumbuzo Sethuntsa said the municipality will work with stakeholders to make sure that communities receive basic services.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
