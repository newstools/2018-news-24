Elaine Panter was reported missing on October 4, when she did not return from fetching her son at his pre-school. The woman’s family took to Facebook, asking for information about her whereabouts, and opened a missing person’s case two days later, according to TimesLive. Panter was found in Primrose. A family member told TimesLive that the boy had been found with her, but that he was dirty, hungry and crying. They said it was not the first time Panter had gone missing. A Facebook friend of Elaine’s said on social media that she had been found with friends. Police spokesperson Captain Juanita Coetzee said a family member had opened a case against Panter for theft of a motor vehicle. She said Panter had been detained and would most likely appear in court within the next 24 hours. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
