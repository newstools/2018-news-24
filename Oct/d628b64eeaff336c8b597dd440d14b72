Kelvin Suddason South Africans on Twitter reacted angrily to Finance Minister Tito Mboweni's remark on Wednesday that "we need to pay our tolls". Mboweni was in Parliament on Wednesday for his maiden budget speech and got many hot under the collar for his comment. "If we want a road transport infrastructure that works, we need to pay our tolls," Mboweni told the National Assembly during the mini budget speech. The statement was not well-received by the South African Twitterati, particularly those in Gauteng, who took to the social media platform to voice their frustration. For many, the response was clear: "No to e-tolls!" Tito #mtbs we will not pay for #etolls The scheme has failed. You canâ€™t simply say we must pay. The scheme is costly, inefficient, expensive and unworkable. Unlawful due to no meaningful consultation. Grossly irrational policies will not be supported by the people @OUTASA #MTBPS2018 #TitoMboweni "User pays"? Users paid for roads via their taxes! Should not have to pay for collection of tolls. Levies via tax system more effective. #eTolls have fallen. Sorry, no more #guptas funding  I will NOT pay etolls until the money set aside in preparation of the 2010 SWC for infrastructure but that largely went to overseas companies and the rest looted, are recovered. We can't continue to feed the beast. STOP payments until looting is stopped and $ recovered. #etolls  Repay #etolls debt from gazillions stolen by ANC and its cadres. Get some money from cabinet reduction savings.Garnish cadres' pensions if needs be, but as for me and my family, we say no to double taxation.  @tito_mboweni take your #etolls and shove them. You tell us to pay and then you go on to governments poor project management. Maybe the anc should have sorted out their project management before trying to rob the public with #etolls . Screw your and your anc #MTBS  Some warned against an ANC defeat in Gauteng at the next general election. watch them lose Gauteng come 2019 #etolls  Minister @tito_mboweni says we must pay #etolls - This is in direct conflict with a decision taken by @GautengANC - @David_Makhura @ismailvadi @OUTASA  Tito Mboweni zero-rates sanitary pads & flour then brings back #etolls, saves us R10pm in exchange for a R500pm increase in expenses. #MTBPS2018Come 2019, let's remind them why they lost Gauteng to DA in 2016. They've forgotten.??  This is definitely a final nail in the coffin of this corrupt govt. #etolls Minister Tito Mboweni said in his #MTBPS2018 that citizens must pay #Etolls. On the other hand Gauteng Premier David Makhura in his State of the Province Address stated that etolls have failed. #Elections2019 will be pretty interesting pic.twitter.com/ys7xj2eAH5  Others preferred to use humour to quell their frustrations. #MTBPS2018 Tito Mboweni gives green light for #eTolls, he's crazy??@EducationGP and @GautengANC say one thing, but @GovernmentZA @tito_mboweni say the opposite. We see you, electioneering in its worst form. pic.twitter.com/RVNJBXpgS9  Tito was doing OK until #etolls.  They must be joking on #etolls ???? #MTBPS2018  Am registering a new political party to contest the elections in 2019. People Agains E-Tolling Party (PAEP). Who is with me?#etolls    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
