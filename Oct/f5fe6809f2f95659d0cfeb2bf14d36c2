In a statement, South African National Parks (SANParks) said the money would be used by the air wing, based at the Skukuza airport – "an integral part of anti-poaching operations". "We are happy to hand over this well-needed donation and we are confident it will be used for its purpose because it is for a good cause. We have met and interacted with the Rangers Corps, including the pilots. We are extremely proud to be able to assist and this is the beginning of something big," Pietersen reportedly said at the handover on Monday. The park's managing executive, Glenn Phillips, said the donation would go a long way towards helping to protect the country's natural heritage. "We have always said, partnerships will help us to get on top of this challenge," he said. "We are happy the Legacy Experience listened and obliged." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
