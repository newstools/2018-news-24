On Friday, Western Cape police spokesperson FC van Wyk revealed that the remains belonged to a woman. When the "human remains" were discovered on Sunset Beach in Milnerton on October 4, some hoped they could be the closure needed by the family of a man who drowned nearby or that of the Hout Bay fisherman who went missing in an anti-poaching operation. Read: 'Human remains' wash up on Cape Town beach A photo that did the rounds on social media, which was said to be of the remains, appeared to show a human skeleton with its feet still intact. At the time, police said they would be conducting a DNA test for the person's identity and a post-mortem to establish the cause of death. "The DNA results show that the bone structure of the human remains that were found at Sunset Beach, Milnerton, is that of a female and the cause [of death] is unknown," Van Wyk said. Officials were unable to determine the woman's identity. The investigating officer has asked anyone who has reported a female relative missing in the area to come forward for DNA samples.
