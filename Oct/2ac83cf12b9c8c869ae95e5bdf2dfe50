experiencing stomach pains, the bride had an ultrasound and was diagnosed with
inoperable pancreatic cancer. Julie
Allen, an ambulance worker from Hayle in Cornwall, England, was told she has
just months to live after the tumour was found, Daily Mail reports. She’d married Ian Allen, a
fellow ambulance worker, just two days before the diagnosis. Although
she is getting chemotherapy, doctors informed her that an operation would be
too risky because of the location of the tumour, Mirror writes. “After the
ultrasound, I got a call to say they’d found a shadow,” Julie says. “I wasn’t
worried. I didn’t think it would be anything because I felt so good.” Julie says the
first thing she thought of was that she wouldn’t be able to celebrate her first
wedding anniversary or experience Christmases with her grandkids. “I actually
went out and bought four years’ worth of cards for them all, in case I wasn’t
around,” she adds. Although
she hasn’t been given a prognosis yet, people with this type of inoperable
pancreatic cancer usually have about nine months to live, Cornwall Live writes. “I have
been up to the Royal Free Hospital in London and spoken to a professor up there
who’s agreed to operate, providing the tumour shrinks. I’ve contacted every
clinical trial going,” she says. Julie will
have to take a lot of time off from work whilst undergoing treatment and with
her medical costs piling up, her colleague Nicola Rashleigh decided to start an
online fundraising page to help ease the family’s financial burden. Donations
have been pouring in from friends, family and even patients she’s helped over
the years as an ambulance worker. Sources: Daily Mail, Cornwall Live, Mirror  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
