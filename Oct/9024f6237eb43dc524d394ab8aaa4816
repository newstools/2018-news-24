The defence force said on Wednesday that Private Elias Mogaki and his girlfriend, Private Nomathemba Ngeleka, had both belonged to the 5 South African Infantry Battalion in Ladysmith. They were in the DRC as part of the Force Intervention Brigade, which is a UN peacekeeping initiative to keep citizens safe from rebel groupings. Mogaki opened fire on Ngeleka and then tried to take his own life immediately afterwards, spokesperson Brigadier General Mafi Mgobozi said.

A Court of Military judge found him guilty of the murder on June 18, 2018 and sentenced him to 20 years in jail. Last week, the Court of Military Appeal upheld the sentence, Mgobozi said. "The SANDF is in the process of dishonourably discharging [Private] Mogaki," he said.
