Traffic diverted Further along and also on the N1, a woman was killed and two other people were seriously injured in a collision near Worcester on Wednesday night. Africa said the woman died when two trucks and her car collided between Worcester and Rawsonville. That section of road was still closed early on Thursday morning while authorities worked to clear the scene, and motorists were advised to divert to the old N1 on that stretch of the route.

Authorities understand the crash occurred when one vehicle failed to stop at a stop sign.  The father and daughter who died were travelling in the one vehicle, while the driver of the other vehicle was seriously injured. Four passengers in the second vehicle were slightly injured.
