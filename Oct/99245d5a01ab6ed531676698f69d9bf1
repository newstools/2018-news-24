left in a coma after a school fight on 28 September at Withernsea High School,
reports Metro. Oliver Whitehead (13) had to be resuscitated at Leeds
General Infirmary – where he was rushed by air ambulance – and when his
condition deteriorated the teen was put in an induced coma, writes Meaww. While it’s still not clear what happened at the school and
exactly how the altercation took place, his mom, Leanne Tindale, speaking to Hull
Live on 30 September said, “Oliver is now out of his coma and off the
breathing machine. “He’s been put on a heart ward now where the staff will do
more tests on his heart as it stopped twice.” She added that her son was still confused and not making
much sense when he talks, nor can he remember how he got to hospital in the
first place. “I’m very tired and
exhausted and I will be staying by his side. But I have three other children
who are being looked after by my mum,” she said. Authorities are still investigating what happened at the
school that led to the boy’s hospitalisation. A spokesperson from Humberside police said, “His family is
being supported by specially trained officers. Two teenage boys were arrested
in connection with the incident, both have been bailed while inquiries
continue." Sources: Metro,
