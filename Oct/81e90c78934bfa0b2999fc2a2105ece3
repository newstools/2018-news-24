1,5 million tons of plastic was manufactured in South
Africa in 2017. While some of this was reusable plastic, the rest was
of the flimsier kind. This means that, best-case scenario, it will be sent
for recycling or, worst, it will end up as litter, choking up our seas and
waterways. According to the
World Economic Forum if nothing drastic is done by 2050 the oceans will contain
more plastic than fish.
