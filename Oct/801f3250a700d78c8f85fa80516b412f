In a statement, the department said 228 050 pupils have already been placed – 123 548 were Grade 1 placements and 104 502 were Grade 8 placements. "It must be noted that a total of 54 773 or 19.37% of [pupils] have not been placed, 25 913 Grade 1 and 28 860 Grade 8," the department said. "It is concerning that about 34 109 [pupils] have not submitted required documents as per admissions regulations." The department said it was working tirelessly to ensure that all unplaced pupils who applied during the application period were placed by the October 31 deadline. "We wish to appeal to parents who have not yet submitted required documents to immediately visit their nearest district office for necessary submission. It is paramount [to emphasise] that failure to submit required documents will hinder the process of placing all affected [pupils]," said GDE spokesperson Steve Mabona. Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi stressed that parents should not despair as "we are working around the clock" to ensure that all pupils are placed. The department added that all unplaced pupils would be offered placements at schools where there was available space. It might not be at the schools they prefer. "The department has a total of about 2 013 public ordinary schools that offer Grade 1 and 8. It must be noted that the majority of these schools received applications beyond their school capacity," said Mabona. "To date, more than 440 schools have unfortunately reached capacity and we will not overcrowd them."
