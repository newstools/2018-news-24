"The first incident occurred shortly after 12:00 on Sunday when three people aged 22, 23 and 35 were escorted and attacked by the mob accusing them of terrorising the community in Extension 37," police spokesperson Constable Tumisang Moloto said. Moloto said the police managed to rescue the three men. He said one of the men later succumbed to his injuries in hospital. Alleged robbery gone wrong In another incident, two armed men robbed a tuck shop in Extension 25 and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash, he said. He added that after the alleged robbery, the two suspects got involved in an argument that led to one of them drawing a firearm and killing the other. "The community members gave chase and apprehended the suspect, and they assaulted him with stones. He also succumbed to his injuries," Moloto said. Moloto said two unlicensed firearms had been recovered by police and cases of murder and attempted murder had been opened for further investigation.     24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
