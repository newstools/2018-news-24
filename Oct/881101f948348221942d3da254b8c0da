R140 000 has been raised for the family of the 7-year-old girl who was
allegedly raped at a Dros franchise in Pretoria last month. The fundraising campaign was
created on donations-based crowdfunding platform BuckaBuddy and was launched on
October 3. According to the platform, the initiative
has received contributions from within South Africa and abroad. It said one
donor contributed $2 122.47 (about R31 000). BuckaBuddy COO, Catherine Du
Plooy was in contact with the family's spokesperson, Kiniel Muthray, who said
the family was grateful. "The
family is still trying to come to terms with the shock, physical and emotional
trauma that this matter has caused," Muthray said. The funds will only be released directly
to the family or to relevant practitioners identified by the family to help
cover any needs the girl might have, the funding platform added. "The campaign for this young
girl is still accepting donations and funds raised will be used for their
intended purpose - to help rebuild her life and cover any needs the family has
during this difficult time," Du Plooy said. The
man accused of raping the girl on September 22 appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court earlier
this month and was denied bail. He
is expected to appear in court again on November 1. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
