Thlabi took to social media on Monday to confirm that Gigaba's lawyers had sent her a letter, asking to retract her public allegations regarding the new visa regulations for children. "So last week an ex-colleague got a call from honourable Gigaba's lawyers asking for my home address," Thlabi tweeted. "I kindly gave my lawyer's address. He received a letter today, basically asking I retract within seven days, or else. So, no summons yet, just a request for apology & retraction." Last month, Gigaba announced that documentation proving parental consent for a minor to travel was no longer a requirement. Thlabi then accused Gigaba of implementing policies "without empirical evidence" and that the problem was "his ego". She also alleged that Gigaba's amendments to the policy had been influenced by a personal incident involving his former wife and daughter and added a link to an article relating to his daughter's travel arrangements. Gigaba retaliated by threatening Thlabi with legal action for defamation of character, according to a statement on the Department of Home Affairs letterhead.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
