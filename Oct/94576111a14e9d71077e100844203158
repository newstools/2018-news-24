Both Retief and Latiefa Mobara, executive director of the Press Council of South Africa, confirmed to News24 that he will leave the organisation early in 2019. According to Retief, his decision has nothing to do with the media environment or controversy around previous rulings. Mobara said Retief’s resignation is because of personal reasons.

It was established in 2012 after an investigation by the Press Freedom Commission headed by the late former chief justice Pius Langa. The commission recommended a stronger system of independent regulation of the media and bigger public involvement in the process. The Press Council is a voluntary body and most media houses in the country subscribe to its code of ethics and oversight. Retief's most recent judgment was published on Tuesday, in which he dismissed a complaint by Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu against the Sunday Times.
