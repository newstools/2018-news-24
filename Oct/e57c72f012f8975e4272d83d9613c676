Avril Fillies Learners in and around Fish Hoek have until Friday 5 October to apply online for an NSFAS bursary at the Forward Fund Academy in Kommetjie Road, Capri. “We hosted the event last week and assisted approximately 32 walk-in bursary applications and many more telephonically. There is a great need for the support we are offering, therefore we have extended our support until Friday,” says Tina Thiart, director of the Academy. The service is free of charge and all applicants were helped by the Academy. All the information is available on the website of the NSFAS. “If you are a South African citizen you can apply for a bursary. The combined annual household income must not exceed R350 000 per annum and if you are a Sassa grant recipient, your parents can apply for the bursary. The learner must also register for the first time for an undergraduate qualification at a public university or be registered at a public TVET college for one of the National Vocational Certificates or on a 191 programme,” she says. Other criteria apply. According to the website, the NSFAS will only provide financial assistance to students who have applied and have been accepted at public universities and TVET colleges. Students who intend to study at private institutions will not be assisted by the NSFAS. The website also states that application results will be communicated to all applicants on a date to be announced in January 2019 via cellphone numbers or email addresses provided by applicants in their application forms.
