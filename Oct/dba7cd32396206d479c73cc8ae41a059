His case was postponed to December 13 for further investigation. The court heard last Wednesday that the psychologist's report on the child and the DNA analysis report had not yet been completed. The man, 43, previously appeared briefly via video link from Westville Prison, but he appeared in person on Tuesday. The court explained to him that it couldn't tell him his next court date previously due to technical problems with the video link. Unlike on the previous court dates when he appeared in person, the accused appeared in an empty court, with only a few journalists following the case. There were also no members of the public protesting outside court. His case generated a huge public interest when it began. The accused is alleged to have raped the child between 2013 and 2018. The man is charged with rape, sexual grooming of children, and exposure or display of or causing exposure or display of child pornography or pornography to children. He also faces charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, compelling or causing children to witness sexual acts, and child abuse or the deliberate neglect of a child. The man was allegedly assaulted by Verulam residents and security guards on June 11, after allegations emerged that he had been raping the little girl since her mother's death five years ago. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
