The case was set down for pre-trial proceedings but Rodrigues' legal team, headed by advocate Jaap Cilliers SC, indicated that he intended to apply for a permanent stay of prosecution.

Monama previously said the matter was 47 years old and "needs to be attended to as quickly as possible". Last year, the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria found that Timol died at the hands of the apartheid security branch police while in detention.

Rodrigues is currently out on bail.               24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
