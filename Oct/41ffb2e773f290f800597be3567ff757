Two men allegedly
tried to snatch babies and their mothers at Addington Hospital in Durban last
week. According to
reports by the KwaZulu-Natal department of health, the unknown men with fake
departmental name tags gained access to the hospital and tried abducting the mothers
and their newborns. The unidentified
men reportedly pretended to be hospital staff and told the mothers they were
sent to collect them and their offspring to help them register birth
certificates. Their plan,
however, was blocked by an on-duty nurse. It’s said the nurse refused to
release the mothers and babies. The would-be abductors
left the hospital shortly afterwards. KZN department of
health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo has praised the nurse’s actions. “We are really
taken aback. This has all the makings of attempted human trafficking,” the MEC said
in a statement sent to DRUM. He further
revealed that the department works in partnership with the department of home
affairs to use the online birth certificate registration system. The system ensures
all children who are born at major hospitals leave with a birth certificate. “We are therefore
extremely grateful to the sister in charge who was vigilant and listened to her
instinct and decided not to release the mothers and their babies. “It’s
reprehensible that people would go to such lengths as to reproduce departmental
name tags and try to commit something so heinous. The pain and suffering that
could have resulted from this is unimaginable,” MEC Dhlomo said. He then urged all
security personnel, nursing staff and mothers to be extra vigilant in hospitals.
