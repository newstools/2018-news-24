The man was arrested in the area, which is south-west of Johannesburg, on Monday. It is alleged that, on Friday night, the accused, who was driving his vehicle around the area, met with the teen, aged 15. The teenager and the suspect are known to each other. The 15-year-old told police that she was on her way home in Westonaria after she had visited her mother in Rietvallei outside Kagiso, west of Johannesburg, when she met the accused. According to police spokesperson Warrant Officer Raymond Sebonyane, the teenager had asked the accused for a lift home. "The suspect agreed and they travelled together in his vehicle. He bought the victim liquor and the two drove around Westonaria." Sebonyane said, at about 04:00 after the minor had consumed liquor, the suspect took her to a guesthouse in Westonaria where he allegedly raped her. The teenager later laid a rape charge against the accused. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
