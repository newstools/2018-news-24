The Sowetan reported that Siyanda Mjoli‚ 18‚ had died at the Far East Rand Hospital over the weekend. In August, an angry group of people in Daveyton dragged a 17-year-old boy to a local high school and demanded that he point out gang members at the school. They then put a tyre filled with petrol over the teen and "necklaced" him. It was not clear which individuals were part of the group, and whether or not gang members played a part. High levels of vigilantism They had set him alight in full view of the students, after he was not able to identify any of them. He did, however, allegedly name some of his friends, News24 earlier reported. Following the high levels of vigilantism in the area, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi and Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane visited the school. "We strongly condemn the disruption of schooling and urge the community to remain calm and allow the law to take its course," Lesufi said in a briefing at the school during the visit in August.
