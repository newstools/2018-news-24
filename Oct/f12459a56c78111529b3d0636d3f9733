According to a lawsuit filed in the Nevada district court on 27 September, the Juventus star allegedly raped a woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in Las Vegas and paid her more than R5 million to keep quiet, reports Metro. Ronaldo has vehemently denied these claims, which he referred to as ‘fake news’ and accused the 34-year-old woman of trying to cash in on his fame. The girlfriend of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner also showed support for her man in an Instagram post shared this weekend. “You always transform the obstacles that are put in your way into impulse and strength to show how great you are,” Georgina Rodriguez’s post read. “Thank you for making us enjoy each game. Always more and better. I love you @cristiano,” it continued. She claims Ronaldo entered her bathroom and pulled her into the bedroom where she was assaulted. The woman alleges she was sodomised by Ronaldo resulting in severe injuries, including but not exclusive to, anal bruises, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.
