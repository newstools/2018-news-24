This is pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct, the City said in a statement on Tuesday. "The City’s leadership took this step after refuse removal services were disrupted two weeks ago as a result of the inadequately managed contract," said Group Corporate and Shared Services MMC Ntombi Khumalo. Khumalo said the contracts relating to Pikitup’s non-specialised, specialised and red fleet were now the subject of an investigation.

Khumalo said the City has since appointed officials to act in the positions of those who had been suspended, in order to ensure that tenders were finalised as a matter of urgency. "The residents of Joburg can rest assured that the multi-party government is doing all it can to ensure that allegations of misconduct are addressed and services are not interrupted," she said.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
