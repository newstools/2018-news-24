The Museum Passport Competition is held as an annual collaborative marketing effort put together by the Msunduzi Museum, the KwaZulu-Natal Museum, and the Old Prison Museum. Muzi Thusi Primary School won second prize while Shine Primary School claimed third prize with the schools walking away R15 000 and R10 000 respectively. Georgetown High and Muzi Thusi Primary School won a bonus prize of R2 500 each for bringing in the most pupils to attend the competition. “The competition this year was designed to align the museum’s offering with the Caps system to benefit learning programmes at the schools. The competition was also extended into the third term to allow schools more time to visit the museum,” said Viranna Frank, who is in charge of Public Relations and Marketing at the museum. Frank said the museums were very pleased with the response to the competition and look forward to the tenth anniversary of the competition to be held in 2019.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
