Mabuyakhulu was arrested earlier this year along with seven others. Mabuyakhulu, his co-accused and their companies are collectively facing 77 charges. But the case is going nowhere fast. READ: Top ANC leader from KZN and co-accused back in court over North Sea Jazz Festival On Tuesday, it was postponed until February 2019 for the State to respond to more requests for further particulars to the charge sheet. Mabuyakhulu's co-accused are Ceaser Walter Mkhize, Mabheleni Ntuli, Mzwandile Basil Ninela, Nonhlanhla Brenda Ninela, Nothando Lorraine Zungu, Ntokozo Ndlovu and Njabulo Mbongwe Mkhize. The companies involved are Desmond Khalid Golding, DMD Capital PTY LTD, Ishashalazi Production CC, Ishinga Holdings, Maqhoboza Traders CC, Shaka Holdings, Soft Skills Communications 100 CC and Supersize Investment 20CC. It is alleged that they were paid for their services, even though the event was cancelled. At a previous court appearance, Mabuyakhulu's advocate Jimmy Howse said he was only facing six of the 77 charges, involving R300 000, and suggested that his case should be separated from the rest. He asked for a "swift response" to the request for further particulars. On Tuesday, he agreed to the adjournment until next year.
