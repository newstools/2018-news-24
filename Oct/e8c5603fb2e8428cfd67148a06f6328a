August's resignation was followed by four more DA councillors, including mayoral committee members Siya Mamkeli and Suzette Little. The other two are Greg Bernado and Thulani Stemela. LIVE: DA are a 'bunch of liars and deceivers', say former DA councillors De Lille used her address to the city council on Thursday morning to launch a counter-attack on those accusing her of corruption, ahead of a discussion of an explosive report into malfeasance in the City's administration which will follow later in the meeting. "I have been fighting corruption all my life and I will not allow my good name to be smeared," De Lille said. She also decried the leaking of the confidential Bowmans report into corruption and maladministration. "It is grossly unacceptable that councillors would leak information with malicious intent to injure my name. But this is nothing new," she said. Allegations 'racist bully attacks' "I have suffered vicious attacks to my good name for more than a year and still people are intent on destroying me." She said she would welcome any investigation and described the allegations against her as "racist bully attacks". Patricia de Lille says she will take legal action against those who accused her of using public money to renovate her house if they don’t apologise #CityOfCapeTown @TeamNews24  After the question session following her speech, her strong supporter August, who came with her to the DA from the ID, said he couldn't stand what was happening in the council and resigned as chief whip, councillor and DA member. In conclusion, I want to thank my family, colleagues, friends and those I have served in our communities for their support and commitment through my political journey. I pledge to continue being a servant for the people and will continue to work tirelessly for a better SA.  The ANC started singing and dancing after his announcement. Shortly thereafter the DA asked for a break in proceedings to caucus, much to the ANC's amusement, whose members resumed their dancing and singing. After the break, four more DA councillors announced their resignation. They hugged De Lille as they left the chamber. The ANC asked for another caucus. Speaker Dirk Smit granted it, but announced that he would adjourn the meeting at 15:30, and they would then deal with the Bowmans report in committee.
