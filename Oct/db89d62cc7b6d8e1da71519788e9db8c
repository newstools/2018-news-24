"One thing that I learnt is the three Es: Education, entrepreneurship and an efficient government," the president tells delegates. Ramaphosa then says that "we should treat our entrepreneurs as heroes". "We have become accustomed to…treating our entrepreneurs and businesspeople [badly] and called them all sorts of names. We’ve treated them like enemies and…white monopoly capital – that must end today," Ramaphosa says to huge applause.

Editors Ferial Haffajee, Adriaan Basson and Peter Bruce were targeted by the WMC campaign in a barrage of tweets published by Twitter "bots". In September last year, Sunday Times reported that Bell Pottinger’s account team working for the Gupta-owned Oakbay was primarily responsible for devising the campaign. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
