In August Mohammed Ebrahim was granted bail of R2 500 as the State had failed to bring further evidence since his arrest on July 28."The State says that there was information [gathering] and tracking in finding him," defence lawyer Chris Gounden said during the bail hearing."The truth is he was not running. He was in the Durban CBD and had no money to get anywhere. His boss from work called him and he willingly told him where he was. That is how he was arrested. There was no evasion." READ: Tears and heartache at Miguel Louw's funeral The State's case hinges on video evidence, which indicates that Ebrahim was the last person seen with the little boy.The video footage shows Ebrahim buying Miguel KFC near his school on Rippon Road in Sydenham.It was unclear whether Miguel had entered the taxi with Ebrahim after the visit to the KFC.Proceedings were disrupted by emotional outbursts from Miguel's family, including his mother and grandmother who walked out of court saying that the justice system had failed them.
