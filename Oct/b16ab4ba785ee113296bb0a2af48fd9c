Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke released the annual survey in Pretoria on Thursday morning. According to the statement, household crimes increased by 5% - to a total of 1.5 million incidences - while individual crime also increased by 5% - to a total of 1.6 million incidences - affecting 1.4 million individuals aged 16 and above. READ: Victim surveys show that crime may be dropping, yet fear is rising "Northern Cape had the highest increase in both household and individual crimes. "Housebreaking or burglary was the most dominant (54%) crime category among crimes measured by the VOCS. An estimated total of 830 000 incidences of housebreaking occurred in 2017/18, affecting 4.25% of all South African households. 1 545 701 incidences of household crime occurred in South Africa in 2017/2018, up by 5% compared to the previous year #StatsSA https://t.co/K7jtkharjk pic.twitter.com/iRBAsGTni7  "Nearly 32% of items stolen during housebreaking were clothes, followed by cellphones (24%) and food (22%). "An estimated 156 000 home robberies occurred last year, affecting 0.8% of all South African households. This was an increase of 3% compared to the previous year. Theft of livestock, poultry and other animals which occurred in 2017/18, is estimated at 159 000 incidences, affecting 0.77% of households in South Africa.

Theft of personal property was the most dominant individual #crime, accounting for 41% of individual crimes #StatsSA https://t.co/K7jtkharjk pic.twitter.com/cQcs1XZnBW  Murder on the rise "Murder increased during the past three years, both in terms of the total number of incidences (VOCS) and the number of cases reported to the South African Police Service (SAPS). "It is estimated that 16 809 incidences of murder occurred in 2017/18, which is an increase of 4% compared to the previous year. Usually, VOCS figures are higher than SAPS figures because not all crime incidents are reported to the police. This is not the case for murder, where SAPS figures are double the VOCS figures. Not all murders are known to households, for example, murders of immigrants or street people, which is one of the reasons that SAPS figures are higher than those of VOCS.
