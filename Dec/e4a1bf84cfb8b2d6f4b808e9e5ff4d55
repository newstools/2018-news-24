Zuma faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering, and racketeering. Zuma, who cast a contrasting figure in the courtroom with his head down as he waited for proceedings to kick off, danced and sang to his famous Umshini Wami song outside the court. Zuma appeared downtrodden in court, with his advocate Michelle Hellens stating that his demeanour was down to the fact that he was unwell, but once outside and in front of his supporters this did not seem to be the case as he danced and urged his supporters to vote ANC. Though load shedding caused a stir, the show went on with advocate for the state Billy Downer saying they were ready for criminal proceedings to take place. “We have come to an agreement for the criminal proceedings to take place and would like that the case be postponed to May 20, 2019 in order to exchange paper,” said Downer. Zuma’s advocate, Hellens, said in his reply that Zuma had not been given letters from the state despite applying for them on various occasions, stating that this was not fair. “We need to have a timetable put in place for answering papers objectively and nothing more,” stated Hellens. KZN Deputy Judge President Mjabuliseni Isaac Madondo told the court that the timetable needed to be adhered to by the state and Zuma’s defence. Outside the Pieter­maritz­burg high court, supporters rallied to hear Zuma speak who, after casting a shadowy figure in court, took the microphone and began urging the crowd to support the party he once lead and thereafter broke into song.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
