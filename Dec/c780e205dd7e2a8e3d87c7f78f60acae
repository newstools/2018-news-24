Tutu along with other members of the TRC are expected to join the dinner which will take place at a Stellenbosch hotel. The dinner is the final item on the programme of an international conference, titled; Recognition, Reparation, Reconciliation – The Light and Shadow of Historical Trauma, hosted by Stellenbosch University. According to the conference's Roger Friedman, the conference has been examining the trans-generational impacts of past trauma (slavery, colonialism, apartheid, genocide) on the lives of descendants, both victims and perpetrators. Earlier this week, the former vice-chairperson of the TRC, Dr Alex Boraine died at the age of 87. "He had a fall a week ago and stopped eating. He just became weaker and weaker," Boraine's son, Jeremy Boraine, told News24 Read: Former TRC vice-chairperson Alex Boraine dies at 87 According to Jeremy, his father was in remission from cancer, but had been in decline of late. Jeremy said his father passed away somewhere between midnight and 02:00 on Wednesday, at his home in a retirement village in Constantia, Cape Town. "We remember him first as a loving and wise husband, father and grandfather.
