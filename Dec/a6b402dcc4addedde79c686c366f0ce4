Fever Reporter UMUZIWABANTU Municipality says they will not sit back and watch people dying on the roads due to accidents that could have been avoided. On December 14 the municipality held its first mayoral roadblock of the festive season. The aim of the programme was to welcome visitors to the municipal area and to give out road safety messages to those who are travelling to different parts of the country. Mayor Dixie Nciki along with her team welcomed motorists and alerted them on a few things that they need to bear in mind when travelling long distance. Motorists were encouraged to ensure that their tyres were in excellent condition and that they were not travelling with expired drivers licences or licence discs. “This was the first time the municipality has rolled out this programme and it was a resounding success. We are planning to continue with these roadblocks and we are hopeful that it will attract more visitors to our town,” said Nciki. The municipality plans to continue with this programme in conjunction with the local South African Police Services and Road Traffic Inspectorate (RTI).   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
