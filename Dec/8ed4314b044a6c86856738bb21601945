Mkhwanazi has been acting in the position since May 22 after taking over from Major General Bheki Langa, who was also acting in the position. Mkhwanazi succeeds former provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Mmamonnye Ngobeni who resigned from the post in November. News24 reported in March that Ngobeni, who had been suspended for almost two years over allegations that she had a "cosy relationship" with controversial Durban businessman Thoshan Panday, lost her bid before the Supreme Court of Appeal to be reinstated. She resigned just as an inquiry into her fitness to hold office was beginning. Cele said Mkhwanazi had been appointed in order to improve policing in the province. "We have had problems in this province. He has been part of stabilisation, surely life will be much better with him here going forward," said Cele. Cele was speaking at a press briefing at the Gateway Shopping Centre after conducting walkabouts with senior police officials at the mall north of Durban and other malls in the province earlier on Monday. Mkhwanazi said he would focus on reducing the high number of murders, house robberies and hijackings in the province, which he described as "crimes that cause fear to the public". "Those are the priorities that we need to focus on. If we can eliminate those type of crimes at least [members of] society would walk freely, and they would be able to sleep at night without worrying much about criminals," he said.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
