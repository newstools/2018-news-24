As part of the campaign, women were given blankets and gifts to enjoy. On Monday, The municipality held a community dialogue at Sigqumeni Hall to facilitate talk between the community and the municipality. Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma Municipal mayor Philani Shange said cases of domestic violence and forced marriages are high in the area and the municipality has been prompted to conduct awareness programmes. He said most women do not report incidents of abuse because they feel they do not get enough support from relevant stakeholders. “At the dialogue, people complained about SAPS, claiming that they are not assisting them. Women need to be protected at all times, not only on Women’s Month or during the 16 Days of Activism,” he said. Representatives from the African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) in KwaZulu-Natal also attended the event.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
