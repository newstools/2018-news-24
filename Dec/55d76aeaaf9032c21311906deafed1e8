His arrest comes amid an increase in carnage on the stretch of road in the province. Traffic officials understand that the man, who drove a Honda sedan, was headed for Zimbabwe from Gauteng. He is being detained at the Mokopane police station until he appears in court. Limpopo Traffic spokesperson Matome Moremi-Tauyatsoala said that "we continue to warn motorists who are still driving to or past Limpopo, to obey the rules of the road and anyone who undermines the laws will be arrested without favour."
