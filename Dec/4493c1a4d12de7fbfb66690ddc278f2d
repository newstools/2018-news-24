Peters said that police officers from Atteridgeville police station were
 conducting a road block on the R511 and R512 on Saturday when the speeding vehicle
 failed to stop. "A male Constable was knocked down and succumbed 
to his injuries. The member was declared dead on the scene," said Peters in a
 statement. "A male suspect, who was allegedly intoxicated at the 
time, was arrested for culpable homicide and for driving under the 
influence of alcohol." In an unrelated incident also on Saturday, a 38-year-old 
Warrant Officer stationed at National Head Office was declared dead on 
scene after being involved in an accident on the R21 near 
Olifantsfontein. In a statement, acting 
Gauteng commissioner of police Major General Max Masha 
said that their deepest sympathies go out to the families of the 
deceased police officers. "[T]hese deaths are really sad and we thus urge the public
 to observe and respect traffic laws and rather find alternative means 
of transport after indulging in alcohol or drugs," said 
Masha.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
