than 200 000 traveller movements have been recorded at the Beitbridge border post into Zimbabwe in the first half of December. The
border post is the country's busiest land port and, as a result, more
Department of Home Affairs staff were deployed there to manage expected
increases in traveller movements. Home Affairs Minister Siyabonga
Cwele paid a visit to the port of entry on Thursday. He
said he was confident that the border post leading into Zimbabwe was efficient
during its busiest time of the year. "I am happy with the
operations I saw today at Beit Bridge and I'm confident that the measures we
have put in place will assist to ease travel for visitors using this port. We
don't want people to spend a lot of time here at the border whether they are
departing or arriving," the minister said. READ: SA deploys more staff at Beitbridge border post ahead Zim

co-operation between the different state agencies operating at the port. “We'll continue to have increased
capacity at this and all our other border posts until January 9. We appeal to
travellers to ensure that they have all the relevant supporting documents which
should be legible and recently certified," Cwele added. Cwele said he would visit other
ports of entry during the peak season to monitor service delivery and interact
with visitors. "One of the biggest tasks of
[the Department of] Home Affairs is to facilitate ease of travel at our ports
of entry. This has a big impact on tourism, trade and investment. This could
ultimately improve economic growth," he added.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
