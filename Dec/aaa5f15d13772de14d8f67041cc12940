  According to a statement issued by the Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma Municipality communications Unit, at about 9.30 am, a convoy of Hawks vehicles entered the municipality offices in Himeville and locked down the whole premises. They entered the Driver’s Licensing and Testing Centre where they arrested three officials. It is alleged that the officials were involved in corrupt activities. The motor licensing and driver’s licensing and testing centre offices will be closed until the Department of Transport gives the municipality further direction. The communications unit said the Hawks also arrested certain officials at the Municipal Manager’s office in connection with the corruption. “As Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma Municipality, we do not condone criminal activities, however a person is innocent until proven guilty by the courts of law,” stated the municipal manager. We would like to inform our community members that residents can use the Creighton testing centre until further notice.
