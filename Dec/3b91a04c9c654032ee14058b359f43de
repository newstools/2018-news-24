"Our country owes Alex a great debt of gratitude for the outstanding work he did as vice-chair of the TRC." Tutu said it was thanks to Boraine's planning that the TRC got off the ground. He also thanked Boraine's family for their support as he sacrificed his time and effort for reconciliation. Boraine is most famous for proposing the TRC and being its vice-chair alongside Tutu from 1996 to 1998. He was also the co-founder of the Institute of Democracy in South Africa along with Fredrick van Zyl Slabbert. He is survived by his wife Jennifer Boraine, his four children Andrew, Kathryn, Jeremy and Nicholas, their spouses, and seven grandchildren.
