THE community of KwaSibi, in Matatiele, has asked the Alfred Nzo District Municipality to prioritise the area with regards clean running water. Residents say it has been almost four years that they have not been able to get water from their taps. According to residents, a borehole was installed to bring water to the area, but it is just a “white elephant”. A forum called Sibi Water Crisis was established by residents to put pressure on government to deliver water in the rural villages of Magema, Zwelitsha, and Outspan. The forum’s secretary, Bongani Gugushe, said residents who can afford it buy water from the town, but those who cannot get water from streams. He said animals and residents are dependant on streams to get water. “As a community, we have tried to engage the relevant departments in this regard and the problem we are facing has escalated to a level where the community is seriously unhappy,” he said, adding that the taps in the area are also being vandalised. In response, Alfred Nzo District Municipality spokesperson Lubabalo Majenge said the municipality has requested the community disconnect illegal connections of water pipes in their yards in order to facilitate the smooth running of water. “At the moment, the municipality is busy disconnecting water pipes in the affected villages and will also install boreholes. “Illegal connections cause water leaks,” he said.
