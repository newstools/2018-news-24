Fever Reporter PORT Shepstone Regional Hospital was one of many institutions that commemorated the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children as the country embarked on its annual campaign to encourage conversation and action against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and child abuse. The launch of the campaign began with Matron Linda Manipersad leading the attendees in reciting a pledge to support women and children. The pledge highlighted the joint efforts required by government employees and other stakeholders in taking responsibility for the safety of women and children and the maintenance of structures that counsel victims of gender-based violence. One of these structures is the local Thuthuzela Care Centre whose staff are available 24 hours a day to provide victims with support and comfort. Hospital PRO Phumza Morai said the Port Shepstone Hospital would like to remind the public, especially women and children, that they must speak out against any violation of their rights or the rights of others. The hospitalâ€™s social work department hosted an array of activities to engage the community on the subject. Morai thanked the National Prosecuting Authority, ChildLine, the Government Communication and Information System and local non-governmental organisations for attending the 16 Days of Activism events.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
