The suspects face charges of malicious damage to property. According to police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, "the damage caused was estimated at R900 000." The protests on Sunday followed a lecture by Corruption Watch chairperson Mavuso Msimang at the Vodacom Journalist of the Year awards, which included an image depicting EFF leaders Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu as "abusers of freedom". But the EFF denied that it was linked to the acts of vandalism, saying that it had not given any of its members a mandate.  So the EFF “superior logic” brigade were at their best today in Limpopo. They trashed a Vodacom store to make their point. They traumatized staff and conducted themselves with criminal intent. This is fascist behavior of the worst kind. pic.twitter.com/Mpuwr4VD60 — John Steenhuisen MP (@jsteenhuisen) December 2, 2018 Fighters don’t be surprised when @Vodacom gathers journalists to strategies on how to deal with EFF. It just means our fight is right where it belongs, in the belly of the beast: #WhiteMonopolyCapitalismWe would not be doing well if they were not all uniting against us #Asijiki pic.twitter.com/VHUgLgGse5  Meanwhile, the DA in Limpopo said it added a charge of "accessory to a crime against the alleged EFF perpetrators". Premier candidate Jacques Smit said: "We will continue to monitor developments in this case to ensure justice is carried out and that the culprits are held accountable." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
