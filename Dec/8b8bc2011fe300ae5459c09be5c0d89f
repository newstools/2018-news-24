"Under current circumstances, delays could exceed 120 minutes," Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said. Scott said the derailment occurred around 08:30 and the cause was unclear. Transnet's media spokesperson was not immediately available to provide further details. However, the known impact for people travelling on that line is that services are severely delayed. Until Transnet provided a prognosis on clearing the derailment site, Metrorail trains were being held in Parow and Bellville until further notice, Scott said.
