Catherine Constantinides, director of Miss Earth SA, tweeted that the experience was "horrifying". "There was NO SAPS present. Nothing.

It was horrifying," Constantinides tweeted. WATCH: Celebs walk the red carpet at Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 Local and international celebrities took to the red carpet at the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100. "I'm deeply pained by the trauma [and] reality of what we went through last night. It was more than mugging [and] taking phones. You prayed with your life not to be stabbed / punched or brutally attacked, all of which I witnessed." Morning Live host Leanne Manas tweeted: "@JoburgMPD where were you last night AFTER the #GlobalCitizenFestivalSA when people were being mugged & harassed by thugs?? You were everywhere BEFORE the show to ensure no one without access got in - but AFTER??" Global stars such as Ed Sheeran, Eddie Vedder, Beyoncé and Jay-Z performed at the event, hosted by Mandela 100 and the Motsepe Foundation. 'It was shocking' Vanessa Perumal, music publicist and managing director at JT Communication Solutions, told News24 she had attended countless concerts as part of her work and had never experienced anything like this before. "I can’t tell you how shocking it was," Perumal said. "We were walking with thousands of people past the buses towards the Sasol garage to get an Uber. Then we heard people screaming. It was the weirdest thing possible. Youngsters, boys, were running towards us and stealing phones and pulling bags off people. It was chaos, it was so unreal. How was this even possible?"  @JoburgMPD where were you last night AFTER the #GlobalCitizenFestivalSA when people were being mugged & harassed by thugs?? You were everywhere BEFORE the show to ensure no one without access got in - but AFTER?? #Sasol  Perumal said the attacks were bold and random, with the robbers grabbing people’s belongings and then running away. "Nobody could help anybody. Lots of people around us were getting robbed. You think I’m talking nonsense…" According to Perumal, some of the attacks were violent. "We found two cops only when we were getting towards the highway," she said. Perumal said the programme organisers should be held accountable for the lack of security measures, saying that it compared poorly to previous events held at FNB stadium such as the Guns 'N Roses concert on Thursday. 'Worst night of my life' Another attendee, Imaan Moosa, gave a lengthy account of her experience on Twitter, stating that it "was both the best and worst night of my life". "We couldn’t go anywhere because men were stealing and harassing people all around us. We were corralled in. We decided to stay amongst the obviously scared and startled crowd. Strength in numbers. Then a gun shot went off and people started running," Moosa wrote. So sad + disappointed to hear about the terrible incidents of crime at the #Sasol garage post #GlobalCitezenFestivalSA. A stark reminder that we are unable to change the world if we are not safe in our own streets. @SAPoliceService @CyrilRamaphosa are you listening? # SHOUTSA ????  "I've never been so scared. While people were running trying to SAVE themselves, men were coming in close and trying to STILL steal a bag or phone. No one and nowhere was safe. "More gunshots went off. Someone started tasering people. The police did NOTHING. No one could leave because the cars were backlogged and Ubers were unavailable." Another tweet by @MrHavok011 read: "Groups of tsotsi’s run towards the crowds to cause commotion and then grab people’s shit and taunt them. Everyone so scared and them literally laughing and enjoying the chaos." According to Perumal, the attacks appeared to have been well planned and orchestrated. "People were getting robbed left, right and centre. It was a new level of criminal activity." Spokesperson for the event, Alison Bradley, told News24 a statement would be issued on Monday. Global Citizen tweeted: "After such an inspiring evening, we are saddened to hear the challenges people had while leaving the venue. We have been working to support people getting home safely." National SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said: "We are only aware of one robbery, for which one suspect has been arrested. We have not had other cases reported to us yet."  After the concert, a LOT of people needed to Ubers to get home. There were too many people and too little Ubers so whenever you called one, it kept indicating that all services were unavailable. Instead of waiting for an Uber, my friend’s brother said he’d —  Crime made an appearance at the #GlobalCitizenFestivalSA at the end of the concert. The reality of crime reared its very ugly head last night as concert goers feared for their lives! A great evening of hope & love ruined. #GlobalCitizen  Was harrowing to say the least. It was a nightmare of the biggest proportion. And we were utterly helpless, the horror of it will have destroyed people's lives forever.#GlobalCitizenFestivalSA #GlobalCitizen #Sasol A stalk & deeply painful reminder of the crime & lawlessness  It was the events organizers job to ensure that security getting into and inside was tight, not the police!!But it was the police job to be visible when attendees were going home in the street, but they were not therecops are good at escorting rich people & politicians#Sasol  After the concert myself and a friend took Gautrain bus to park Station because we saw how uber prizes just went up. All of us in the bus we saw many people getting robbed at the sasol garage passing. That was horrific ????. — STOP ALBINISM KILLINGS (@thwala_mpho) December 3, 2018 The saddest thing is how #GlobalCitezenFestival advocated for Gender Equality and Safety for all women and yet women were the biggest victim of last night's trauma at #Sasol. #GlobaCitizenFestivalSA #GlobalCitizen how are you going to help those who were affected?  That while Ubers are all canceling we were scared to even take out our phones because they would be taken. Ended up huddling around a cop car after walking forever to find one. Everyone huddled around that car. Imagine huddling around a car for safety? #Sasol  #sasolI survived the Sasol garage trauma.. I didn't want to be there at all. The screams were all I remember. I could see fear in all of us there.If you were there you'd understand when I say i#survived.
