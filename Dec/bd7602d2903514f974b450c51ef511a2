Instead of the usual braai – which you would most probably be doing a lot of this time of year – why not whip up something delicious and easy for your guests? Staffords shares a few recipes you could try to impress your friends and family: Chocolate chip banana bread Ingredients 210g (1½ cups) cake flour 110g (½ cup) sugar 5ml baking powder 2ml bicarbonate of soda 2ml salt 60ml ( ¼ cup) oil 5ml Staffords Vanilla Extract with Seeds 2 eggs, lightly beaten 3 ripe bananas, mashed 170g (1 cup) Staffords Choc Chips To decorate 50g Staffords White Choc Disks, melted Method 1. Preheat the oven to 175° C. Grease a medium loaf tin. 2. Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt into a mixing bowl. 3. Lightly whisk the oil, vanilla extract with seeds and eggs together. Stir in the bananas and pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. 4. Add the chocolate chips and very gently stir the mixture together, being careful not to overmix. 5. Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Bake in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. 6. Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, before turning out onto a cooling rack. 7. Spoon the melted white chocolate into a piping bag and pipe zig-zags across the top of the banana bread. 8. Set aside for 20 minutes to allow the chocolate to set, before serving.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
