In October, a two-year-old girl was attacked by a dog at a day care centre in Witbank. The incident occurred when the toddler asked her carer for juice. According to the carer, the Labrador took the opportunity to bite her without warning. The toddler had injuries to her face, ears, eye socket and tear duct. She underwent a two-hour operation at Highveld Eye Hospital to repair the damage to her eye. Last month, an elderly Camperdown man was mauled by four pit bulls on his property.
