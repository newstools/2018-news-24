Eastridge girls have each received two packs of sanitary pads as part of a continued handover following a mass collection drive. The group of girls have benefited from a donation of 200 packs of sanitary pads by local ward 78 councillor, Eddie Andrews. Warda Cay, chairperson of the Eastridge Walking Bus, approached Andrews after seeing his posts on other distributions on social media. Andrews ran the Cape Town Marathon earlier this year to raise awareness of the need for sanitary pads. He did this by getting businesses and residents to pledge and donate packs of pads for every kilometre of the 42.2km race. His goal was to raise 4200 packs and he just about reached that goal. Andrews had already distributed thousands of packs to local schools, organisations and locals in need as part of his extended project. Cay says: “There are 120 children staying in the half of the crescent. The need in all areas is great and I wish there were more things being done. The government needs to do more.” Cay says she made contact with Andrews at the end of November and an appointment was made. He then did the handover on Wednesday last week. The girls are from the area and are the daughters of the walking bus members. The walking bus has 60 volunteer members. Andrews says it was a pleasure for him to do the handover. “I decided to run the Cape Town Marathon to get pads for young girls. It took me a long time to finish the marathon, just under six hours to finish. I had to work hard to finish it. I also ran to raise awareness that sometimes in our communities, children don’t go to school when they menstruate because they do not have sanitary towels,” he said. He further encouraged the girls to choose success and reach for their goals.
