According to the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), the suspects, an examiner and a data capturer at the Thusalushaka Vehicle Testing Station, will now face charges of fraud. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said the identity document of an innocent person is believed to have been used in the fraudulent transactions to create the impression that the person had delivered the vehicles to be tested.

"These will be used in ongoing investigations," Zwane said. "The arrests are part of an ongoing initiative to ensure a safer festive season by proactively preventing the licensing of unroadworthy vehicles and addressing corruption within the licensing and law enforcement sector." Both officials are expected to appear in court on Monday.    24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
