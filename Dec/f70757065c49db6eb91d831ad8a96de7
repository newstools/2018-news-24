The man also died in the fire, Limpopo police say.

The deceased were identified as Mogau Maela, Chantelle Makobe, Mosa Makobe, and the father Thato Maela. "Fortunately, the partner managed to flee from the suspect unhurt," Ngoepe said. "The police were alerted about this incident. They swiftly responded, together with emergency medical services. On arrival, the EMS certified the three children and the suspect dead." Ngoepe said the motive behind the incident was still not clear, however, domestic violence could not be ruled out.
