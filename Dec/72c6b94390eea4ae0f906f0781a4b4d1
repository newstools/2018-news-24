The event was organised by the station’s Community Policing Forum (CPF) and was aimed at raising awareness of abuse as the area has a high prevalence of such cases. Members embarked on a march around the area of Ward one, carrying placards with messages speaking out against violence against women and children. The event also touched on awareness about school safety, related to a recently reported case of alleged rape at a local school. The event was also attended by the Department of Community Safety and Liaison and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, who addressed the community on matters relating to crime and safety.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
