BEING involved in a brass band and being part of a choir made Upper Highway resident Mxolisi Mdlalose, popularly known as Mxolisi M in the jazz industry, realise his love for music. Talking to the Hillcrest Fever, Mxolisi M said that he’s the child of the highest God, a musician, family man, and educator. “I realised my love for music at the age of 12 when I started picking up a euphonium and a trombone,” he said. He said that even though he had a love for music, there were musicians that he looked up to and they inspired him to get into music. “A couple of musicians inspired me, such as McCoy Mrubata and Jonas Gwangwa who really played a huge role in me getting into the industry,” said the musician. “I was born and raised in the Johannesburg township of Katlehong; then I decided to relocated to KwaZulu-Natal to further my studies after matriculating, which is where I studied music,” he said. Mxolisi M, who holds a degree in Jazz and Popular Music from the University of KwaZulu-Natal and a Diploma in Advise in Music from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he may have been inspired by the two musicians but it was a great honour for him to be mentored by the US saxophonist and lecturer Professor Salim Washington. Mxolisi M released his new single, titled KwaZulu, on Friday, November 30. “In life you need to be determined and never allow any negativity to pull you down. Respect yourself and those around you,” he concluded.
