A search for a second suspect, who ran away after a high-speed car chase, is under way, according to provincial Hawks spokesperson captain Matimba Maluleke. Maluleke said the arrest followed a joint operation by the Hawks and Crime Intelligence which related to two vehicles that were reported stolen in Gauteng and which were en route to Zimbabwe.
