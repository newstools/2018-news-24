READ: Alleged murderer to stand trial for killing Sadia Sukhraj in a botched hijacking Mkhize's alleged accomplice, Siyabonga Bulose, was killed as the two of them attempted to flee from the crime scene. On the day of the incident, the duo allegedly demanded car keys from Sadia's father, well-known Pastor Shailendra Sukhraj, at gunpoint. 33 witnesses to be called The shocked father threw his car keys at the assailants. While they were fleeing the scene with Sadia inside the vehicle, Shailendra fired several gunshots towards the hijackers with his licensed firearm. The Grade 4 Everest Primary School pupil was shot in the chest and was taken to Chatsmed Hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries. Bulose died immediately after the car came to a stop. His cause of death was described as a penetrating gunshot wound to the pelvis. Sadia's death sparked massive public outcry over crime in Chatsworth. Mkhize was arrested by an off-duty police officer a short distance from Sadia's grandparents' home. Mkhize previously claimed in court that police beat him, but prosecutor Surekha Marimuthoo disputed this and countered that Mkhize sustained his injuries from a public beating during his arrest. The State is expected to call 33 witnesses to testify in the murder case.
