Correspondent Tshwane came alive on Sunday as people made their way to the Union Buildings for the Mandela Remembrance Walk and Run. The event coincides with the continued celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the birth of former president Nelson Mandela, and came just days after the fifth anniversary of his death on December 5, 2013. Gauteng Premier David Makhura and Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga were among those taking part in the walk. Jovial mood at the Union Buildings ahead of the Nelson Mandela Remembrance Walk and Run.

Others were just happy to participate and complete the race in a good time. Prizes were also awarded. This Mandela propaganda is too much; we give for Mandela, we walk for Mandela, We remember Mandela, we vote to make Mandela proud. Just wait a minute ?the guy sold us out and died rich and famous. Yall need to wake up from this Madiba Magic hypnosis. #MandelaRWR2018  Jovial mood at the Union Buildings ahead of the Nelson Mandela Remembrance Walk and Run.
