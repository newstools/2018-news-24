Speaking to News24, ANCYL zonal chairperson Thabang Lediga said the best thing for Mabe to do was to remove himself from office until the matter was finalised. "Pule is an ANC member, he knows his responsibilities, he knows our position on gender-based violence and sexual harassment in the workplace," said Lediga. He added that they were not jumping the gun in calling for Mabe to step down before the matter had been heard. "We must treat the complainant as the victim. There is a stigma around such issues, we must stand by her," Lediga said.
