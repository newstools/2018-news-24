One hundred activists started the trek from Marikana, in the North West province, to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Sunday, demanding compensation for the widows of the 34 mineworkers who were killed when police opened fire on striking miners in 2012 in the mining town. Of the 100 activists, 20 made it to the Union Buildings on Wednesday morning to hand over their memorandum of demands to President Cyril Ramaphosa. A group of protesters, demanding the reinstatement of outsourced municipal workers who lost their jobs in 2010 and 2011, met the Marikana marchers. The two groups decided to consolidate their marches in solidarity with each other's causes. The memorandums were received by representatives from the president's office. 'I was shot nine times and survived' One man who survived being shot nine times during the Marikana massacre relives that day. The Marikana activists have vowed to return to the Union Buildings after 21 days of handing over the memorandum.
