RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane told Coastal Weekly that although the proposal has not been implemented, he is hoping it will be soon. “We are pushing ahead with the suggestion to have schedule two, driving under the influence (DUI), speeding and reckless or negligence driving amended to schedule five. We want the Department of Justice to implement a new law,” said Zwane, who added that the RTMC was working hard to submit their suggestions to the relevant departments to ensure that the law comes into effect next year. In a recent joint operation between Metro police and Verulam SAPS, a total of 22 drivers were arrested for drunk driving in Verulam. Tongaat station commander Colonel Santha Moodley assured the community that high visibility will be maintained throughout the festive season. Moodley said regular patrols, road blocks and stop and search will be conducted in the Tongaat area with special focus on intensified police visibility in the Tongaat CBD, on the beaches, and in residential areas. “The safety of the Tongaat community remains a priority for members of SAPS Tongaat and we will continue with festive season public safety campaigns to ensure safer communities. We urge our community to be vigilant all the times and if they witness any criminal activities to contact the police immediately,” Moodley said.
