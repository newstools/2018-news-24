Metrorail is committed to continually ensure that safety for all within its operational environment is prioritised."

"Our efforts in improving commuters travel is a demonstration that Prasa and its business units are doing something so that South Africans enjoy decent and modern public transport services in the coming weeks, months and years to come," Mofokeng concluded.
