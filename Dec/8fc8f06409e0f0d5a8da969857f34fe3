His trial for the murder of Richard Mthabela is expected to commence on April 15. Mcunukelwa will appear alongside two co-accused, Sanele Magida and Paseka Mahloromela. He will be back in court on May 13 to face four counts of murder and another of illegal possession of a firearm. He will appear alongside Magida, Mahloromela, Vuyolethu Kilani, and Mkhululi Mahlangu. According to the charge sheet, which News24 has seen, it is alleged that on June 2017, Mcunukelwa collected Peter Pholle, Welcome Godlo, Sithandile Ngungwana, and Sifiso Msibi-Mdluli and took them to a house in Katlehong to sort out their differences with Kilani. Things took a fatal turn when an argument broke out between all the accused, and Mcunukelwa grabbed a firearm from Magida and started to shoot at Pholle, Godlo, Ngungwana and Msibi-Mdluli. Three of the victims died instantly, with another succumbing to their injuries at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by
