The suspects were found in possession of 61 heroin tablets. Police spokesperson Captain Henry Kisten said the operation was part of the festive season clamp down campaign. “The total value of drugs recovered was R3 000. One arrest was made at the Trenance Park Taxi rank on Moss Street. Other suspects were arrested for dealing in liquor without a license and possession of a dangerous weapon. The detectives under the command of Captain Doorsamy arrested outstanding suspects for offences ranging from housebreaking, assault GBH, assaults and theft related cases.” Station commander Brigadier Victor Dludla commended the members.
