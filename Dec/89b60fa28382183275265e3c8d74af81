According to the navy, it came to light that a civilian mechanical repair workshop was operating from an unused shed at the SAS Wingfield base in Cape Town without the required authority after a whistleblower reported the situation to the South African Navy headquarters. Hlongwane made a surprise visit to the naval base on Friday. "The chief of the navy sees this matter in an extremely serious light and will leave no stone unturned to determine who authorised this arrangement and whether any naval officer may have benefited unduly," the statement read. "The company in question will be ordered to vacate the premises."   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
