The SAPS members of Kinkelbos, in conjunction with the event sponsors, took part in the workshop, with Mrs PE, Sibongiseni Kula, as the guest speaker of the final day of the workshop. The purpose was to empower the community in acknowledging and assisting the youth to identify their full potential and strength, influenced by their surroundings and resulting in sustainable independence. The aim is to continue this event in future. The children, ranging from seven to 17 years old, were exposed to all different types of modelling, health and fitness, photoshoots and promoting themselves to be better people regardless of their backgrounds. They attended the workshops on topics which included basic beadwork, alcohol and substance abuse, domestic violence and child abuse. The activities included a music competition by the local children and the winners in different categories were rewarded with certificates and prizes.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
