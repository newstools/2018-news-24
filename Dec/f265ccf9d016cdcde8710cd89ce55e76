Njilo also stated that he is considering deploying security guards to illegal dumping hotspots to nab offenders. This comes after the mayor conducted oversight visits to several efforts by the City to clean the northern areas on the back of a mass community meeting held recently where residents aired their grievances. Residents complained of the poor condition of the roads, illegal dumping, and unkempt grass. As diggers cleared rubbish strewn at the top of Chota Motala (Old Greytown) Road, Njilo said he was fed up with the constant dumping. “This is not the first time I’ve been here to clear this road. We must name and shame those who dump, then they will learn their lesson.” Njilo said he had given the roads department this week to address roads that were in a bad condition. The roads in question include Gaysingh and Bombay roads; Bangalore Road; Kalappa and Saraswati roads; Khan and South roads; Balhambra Way; and Olympia Way. “The parks department will cut grass that is overgrown,” he said. “I have instructed those in the electricity department to drive around and identify street lights that aren’t working and attend to them.” Meanwhile, the DA have questioned why they were not officially notified about the mass community meeting, despite three wards being under their stewardship,   and have accused Msunduzi of using    the meeting to campaign ahead of elec-tions. Councillor Naleni Naidoo said in a letter that only DA wards were “chosen for             the meeting”, despite the northern areas including wards controlled by other par-     ties. Njilo, however, denied this, and said he was simply invited to the meeting by community members. He said unhappy DA members could use the proper channels to complain if they have a grievance.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
