This follows a post on social media that the mayor was forced by the ANC to resign unless he wants to be fired. Naledi Gaosekwe, ANC spokesperson in the Northern Cape, dismissed the allegations and said the party is still in engagement processes. “There is no such thing. You can refer that enquiry to the person that posted the announcement as to where he got his information from,” Gaosekwe responded. “We are still busy with engagements. Thereafter we will be calling different community meetings to listen to what the branches have to say.” This follows a court ruling by the Northern Cape High Court Judge Cecile Williams that Matika must vacate his office as mayor on Tuesday, 31 July, after the DA filed for an interdict against him. The DA’s action was led by Matika’s refusal to vacate office and hand over his powers to acting mayor Pule Thabane. Matika was removed through a motion of no confidence by the DA, with the support of the EFF, the Freedom Front Plus and ANC councillors, leading to his removal on 25 July during a special council meeting at the Sol Plaatje Municipal chambers. The court interdict is still pending until the finalisation of the matter on 22 August, while the ANC has set up a task team to implement a Section 106 investigation. Actions to remove Matika were characterised by violent march protests, barricaded roads, looting and the torching of buildings. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
