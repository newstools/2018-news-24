She was also receiving counselling. "The executive management has a zero tolerance for incidents of this nature and it is regrettable that it happened during Women's Month when UFS is specifically focusing on various aspects to bring the importance and value of women in society to the forefront," Loader said. Loader said management would continue with messages and actions of awareness, visible safety interventions, ensuring the reporting of such incidents and the speedy conclusion of investigations with the relevant sanctions. In a separate incident over the weekend, a student was allegedly stabbed at a men's residence on the Bloemfontein campus during an altercation. He was in a stable condition in hospital.
