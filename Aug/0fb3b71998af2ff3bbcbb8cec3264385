The City of Cape Town's recreation and parks department is anticipating further damage to infrastructure should the weather predictions come to pass. "The public is reminded that, due to the hazardous conditions created by the recently damaged infrastructure and the extremely dangerous sea conditions expected this weekend, the beach at Milnerton will remain closed in the interest of public safety," a statement said. The recreation and parks department is in the process of establishing a safe public access point at Milnerton Beach. Damaged gabion baskets will be removed and the beach will be reopened to the public once the public access point has been completed. "The City will monitor the situation closely and will undertake all necessary measures to ensure public safety as its main priority, both during and after the high seas," the statement read. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
