Williams said this meant that Prasa was operating unlawfully and is in contravention of the National Railway Safety Act. "In line with the regulatory tools at the disposal of the Regulator, Prasa can be issued with either a prohibition directive, a contravention notice and a penalty, or criminal charges can be instituted."
