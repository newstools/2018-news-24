The Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation Unit arrested Pascal Eze (33) and Pamella Mendrew (26) on Tuesday. They face charges of fraud involving an estimated R1.2m. "During the arrest, the team seized a vehicle, cellphones, bank cards and statements suspected to be the proceeds of crime," Nkwalase said in a statement. The case was postponed to August 21 for a bail application. Nkwalase added that in a separate matter, four people appeared in the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Bellville on Wednesday for alleged vehicle finance fraud. He said Stanford Flandorp, 59, Alicia Knowles, 43, Eva Flandorp, 55, and Garry Bruce, 36, allegedly submitted fraudulent documents that allowed a recruited client to get vehicle finance worth more than R175 000. The four were released on R5 000 bail each and were expected to return to court on September 28.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
