The NPA's KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson, Natasha Kara, told News24 that Kershwin Goldstone, 22, had also been sentenced to a further 55 years for three counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, one of housebreaking with intent to steal, and theft, as well as another of housebreaking with intent to rob. Goldstone was sentenced in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to all the charges. He killed Patricia O'Connor, 92, Roland Heathcote and Patricia Tugwell, both 89, at the Kenwyn Retirement Home and Jacaranda Lodge retirement complex in July. Police previously said that Goldstone had ransacked the residences and taken various belongings, before attacking his victims by strangling them and stabbing them with scissors. His last attack before his arrest occurred on July 31, when he slit the throat of an 89-year-old woman, Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said. Goldman took a TV set and jewellery, and fled the scene on foot, Zwane added. KwaZulu-Natal Director of Public Prosecutions advocate Moipone Noko said: "I welcome the sentence and conviction in this matter as it fits the crime. It is unfortunate that innocent lives of defenceless elderly people were lost through the cowardice of the accused."
