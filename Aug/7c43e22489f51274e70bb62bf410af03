Alex Mitchley Police and protesters taking part in the #TotalShutDown march have clashed in Tshwane after officers forcibly tried to remove marchers blocking the road in front of the main entrance to the Union Buildings. A group of about 20 protesters blocked the road on Wednesday evening and demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa address them. Earlier on Wednesday, around 2 000 women marched to the Union Buildings to protest against oppression, gender inequality and gender-based violence. Once at the Union Buildings, Minister of Higher Education Naledi Pandor arrived to accept their memorandum. However, those participating in the march booed her and said they would only hand over the memorandum to Ramaphosa. By Wednesday evening, only a small group was left. They moved from the lawns to the main entrance of the Union Buildings, sitting in the middle of the road. News24 witnessed police push and shove protesters in an attempt to get them to move from the road. The group pushed back. Police eventually backed off and protesters continued to block the road while singing struggle songs. Ramaphosa's spokesperson Khusela Diko confirmed to News24 that the president would address the group on Wednesday evening.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
