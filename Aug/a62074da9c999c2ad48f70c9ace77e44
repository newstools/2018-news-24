Residents were invited to open their hearts and support the initiative by donating at three major intersections in the metro. Community Chest gave a heartfelt thanks to Caltex EC Marketer (CECM), Caltex Service Stations, Atlas, Round Table PE West 142, MED 24, Heinz in Style, Sun Boardwalk Mr PE Ubermann and Precision for volunteering. “We would like to thank the people of the Bay for their donations. It is overwhelming to see the unity when it comes to giving to the less fortunate,” said Community Chest Eastern Cape public relations officer, Colette Theron. Caltex Magnum Motors went one step further. The forecourt staff and cashiers donated all the tips made on July 27 to the Winter Woolly Drive. “We are pleased to be able to add a smile to a young child or bring warmth and sustenance to the many less fortunate people in the Eastern Cape. The CECM philosophy is to add value not only as the local fuel provider, but also to support, uplift and care about the Eastern Cape communities around us,” said CECM CEO Clive Berlyn. CECM, who have been fuelling the project for more than six years, also provides easily accessible and safe drop-off points at all participating Caltex Service Stations throughout the Eastern Cape. Residents who missed the collections can donate at Caltex Service Stations until the end of August. Donations can also be delivered to the Community Chest offices at 126 2nd Avenue, Newton Park or arranged with Colette at 041 582 1592. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
