The baby went missing on 3 August at Osizweni shopping centre, in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal. According to a statement made by the 21-year-old mother to the police, her baby was allegedly taken by an unknown woman at the centre where she had gone to do groceries. KZN SAPS spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbhele told DRUM that the mother was watching a preacher outside the shops when she was approached by an unidentified woman. "An unknown female approached her and requested to carry the baby for her. The mother gave her the child as she pretended to play with the child. The woman then gave the mother some money to go inside the shop and buy a sandwich for herself while she was 'playing' with the child," reveals Mbhele. However, when the mother returned from the shop, the woman and the child were nowhere to be seen. She says a case of kidnapping was opened at Osizweni SAPS and the docket was transferred to Newcastle FCS for further investigation. "The suspect is in her forties, dark in complexion and was reportedly wearing a black leather jacket and a long white skirt," said Thembeka. She urged everyone who might have information about Luyanda's whereabouts or the suspect to contact the police: Detective Constable TP Mthimkhulu on 082 696 7953 or Crime Stop number on 08600 10111. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
