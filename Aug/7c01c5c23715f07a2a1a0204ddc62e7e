The charges relate to an incident in which Malema allegedly discharged an assault rifle during the EFF's fifth-anniversary celebrations at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. "The case opened by AfriForum must be dismissed as the State is currently busy with issues of high importance. [We as the] NFP [advise] the National Prosecuting Authority to speed up their processes on cases relating to police officers of the apartheid era who murdered political activists," the party's head of communications Sabelo Sigudu said in a statement on Thursday. The NFP referred to AfriForum's charges as a "populist stunt driven by a hatred towards black people". "This is nothing but abuse of resources and [the] legal system, knowing very well that there are serious cases relating to crime, murder and stealing of land in South Africa which are still pending," Sigudu added. "Malema has never killed anybody with the toy gun he used during their 5th celebration (sic)," he said. Sigudu concluded that AfriForum should instead search for the man who handed Malema the gun. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
