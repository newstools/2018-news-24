Police spokesperson Captain Mpande Khoza said the girl went missing at around 17:30 on Friday afternoon. Khoza said a man who worked with the child's grandfather allegedly told her to follow him to his shack. He ostensibly promised to give the little girl R10. "The victim followed the suspect to his shack, where the suspect raped the victim, strangled her and loaded her lifeless body in a rubbish bin and took it across the Golden Highway [where] he dumped the body," Khoza said. The community of Lehae in Lenasia launched a search and found her body in the early hours of Saturday morning. A case of murder and rape was opened.
