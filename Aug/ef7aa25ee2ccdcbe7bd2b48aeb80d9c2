The men face a charge of attempted murder and their case was postponed. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said Mandeni police arrested the men, aged 27 to 41, on Thursday. "The police's thorough investigation led to the arrest of the suspects and the seizure of firearms. The firearms will be subjected [to] ballistic testing to determine whether they were used in the shooting or any other crime," said Zwane. He said the men allegedly shot at the 41-year-old taxi owner multiple times at a local taxi rank on July 31 at about 14:20. "He sustained five gunshot wounds and was taken to hospital for medical attention. The motive [for] the attack is unknown at this stage," he said. The men are in custody until their next court appearance on Monday, Zwane added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
