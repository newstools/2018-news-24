This follows an incident where Malema allegedly shot live rounds from an assault rifle during the EFF's 5th anniversary celebrations at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. In a video published on News24 on Tuesday, Malema can be seen handing the weapon to a man believed to be Snyman. AfriForum wants PSiRA to investigate Snyman's actions and involvement in the incident. The lobby group's head of community safety, Ian Cameron, said Snyman was "a controversial person" who has allegedly had "many run-ins with the law on numerous occasions in the past". Snyman on Friday refused to comment. On Wednesday, AfriForum laid criminal charges against Malema. A legal expert told News24 that Malema could face jail time of 15 years if convicted of the illegal possession of a firearm. EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has denied that a real firearm was used.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
