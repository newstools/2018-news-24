Anisa Sayed Khan, 39, and Zaadhaya Khan, 33, were found guilty of stealing from their mother in 2016 for which they were sentenced in the Durban Regional Court. The two transferred more than R1.5m from their biological mother's bank account into their own after the death of her husband. Police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said a case of theft was opened at the Umzinto police station and was assigned to the provincial detectives for investigation. He said the sisters were arrested, charged and taken to court where they were released on R20 000 bail each. "They were successfully prosecuted and were each sentenced to five years' imprisonment…wholly suspended for five years, on condition that [they] are not convicted [of] a similar offence." Zwane said they each have to pay back R750 000 and their bail "must be cashed and paid to the complainant immediately". "The balance of the payment must be paid on or before October 31, failing which, the sentence will be imposed." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
