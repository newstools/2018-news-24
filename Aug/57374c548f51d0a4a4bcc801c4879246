News24 reported on Thursday that a young soccer player returning from practice was among at least six people who were shot in a volley of gunfire between two gangs in Mitchells Plain. One person was killed. Spokesperson for the Lentegeur Community Policing Forum Anthea van der Vent said some of the people involved in the shooting were known to associate with a gang, but one had nothing to do with gangs.
