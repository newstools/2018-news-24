Teboho Setena The Bloemfontein Regional Court has sentenced a Bloemfontein meter taxi driver, Mthetho Solomon Khauta (36), to life imprisonment. He was convicted and was sentenced on 10 July after being found guilty of violent crimes he committed in 2015. Sgt. Sinah Mpakane, provincial police spokesperson, said investigation had revealed that Khauta (known as Tax), together with his accomplice, ambushed a couple, a 29-year-old man and a 26-year-old woman on 27 September 2015. They were attacked while sitting in their car which they had parked next to the R706 Road to Jagersfontein, near a Lourier Park residence. Mpakane said the attackers robbed the victims of their cellphones and cash. Mpakane said investigation had also revealed the accused had raped the woman after shooting her partner. “The two attackers threatened the victims and the boyfriend started fighting off the suspects. “The accused, who was holding a firearm, fired two shots at the male victim and thereafter raped the female. “The woman managed to go to the nearby house to ask for assistance. The owner of the house took her to a satellite police station of Parkweg near Pellissier to open a case. The male victim was then taken to hospital for treatment.” Mpakane said Khauta was arrested on 21 July 2016, was positively identified and was linked to the crime through DNA tests. She said evidence could not linked Khauta’s accomplice to the crime. “Khauta was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was charged on two counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder and rape,” said Mpakane. WO Willem Leboea, WO Arlene Snyman and Sgt. Elizabeth Mophethe were the investigators assigned to the case. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
