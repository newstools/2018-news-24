The man appeared at the Gauteng South High Court sitting in Palm Ridge on Tuesday. "The accused made admissions in terms of section 222 of criminal procedure act and made admission to 144 charges of sexual assault," the National Prosecution Authority's Gauteng spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane told News24. She added that he was now left with 183 charges which the state would need evidence on in order for him to be charged. Mjonondwane said the case has been postponed to August 27 for the state to start calling in witnesses. The abuse came to light after the accused was caught on a surveillance camera allegedly fondling a 15-year-old pupil's genitals in the common room of the school's hostel in November 2016. He was arrested that month and later released on bail. He later resigned from the school and did not face an internal disciplinary process.
