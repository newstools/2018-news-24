Niekeer Patroos, who has also been charged with public violence, allegedly attacked the officer on the evening of July 12. The violence in the area was sparked by the arrest of Zwelihle Renewal leader Gcobani Ndzongana.

In court on Friday, defence advocate Mafu Masina said that a robbery charge against his client had been withdrawn because the employer's evidence was contradictory. 'Under house arrest' "The senior prosecutor decided that [Patroos] had done nothing wrong in terms of the robbery charge. Now, only the charge of public violence remains," he added. "He has been released on R500 bail on condition that he [does] not participate in any illegal activities and is under house arrest."
