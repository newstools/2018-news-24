The 8th annual Desmond Tutu International Peace Lecture will take place at Artscape in Cape Town, on 8 October – the day after Archbishop Tutu’s 87th birthday. Previous speakers include The Dalai Lama, Graça Machel, Thuli Madonsela, Mary Robinson, the late Kofi Annan, Advocate Hila Jilani and Advocate Vasu Gounden. The event is open to the public but prior registration in order to receive tickets is required. The process of obtaining tickets will be announced in September.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
