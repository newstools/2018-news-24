Robert Sonnekus, 52, was reported missing by his son at the Fish Hoek police station last Sunday, said police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk. "At the missing person's house in Corsair [Way], Sun Valley, blood was found and two safes were found open." He said several items were missing from the house. A body was found at a sand mine in Macassar and identified as Sonnekus' at the Tygerberg mortuary on August 15. "The victim was handcuffed and shot several times in the head," said Van Wyk. A murder docket was opened in Macassar. Sonnekus' vehicle was recovered in Mitchells Plain after it had been stripped in nearby bushes. Van Wyk said three men were arrested for possession of suspected stolen property. He added that a 34-year-old man was also arrested on August 14, although he could not immediately confirm whether this was on a charge of armed robbery or murder. "The accused was out on an early parole for murder," he said. The man was denied bail in the Simon's Town Magistrate's Court on Thursday. The case was postponed until August 31 for further investigation. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
