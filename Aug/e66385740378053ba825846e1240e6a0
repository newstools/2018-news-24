A video has emerged on social media of a
Saps employee at Mamelodi East Police Station in Pretoria – originally thought
to be a local street vendor – certifying documents while wearing what appears
to be a gown-like dress, apron and slippers. Following public backlash police
spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters denies allegations the woman is a street
vendor, saying she’s a Saps employee “authorised to certify documents”. She also
confirms the woman’s dress was inappropriate and not condoned by Saps. Gauteng provincial commissioner of police
Lieutenant General Deliwe de Lange says improving professionalism is part of
their efforts to “improving service delivery levels at all police stations”. “This is the context within which we remain
purposeful in enhancing all front-line service delivery points towards
regaining public confidence and strengthening relations between the police and
the public.” Watch the video below.
