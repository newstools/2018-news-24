This was Tshabalala's second attempt at securing his release on bail. He was initially denied bail in January. The court heard on Thursday that suspended Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) investigator Cedrick Nkabinde's credibility had been called into question. This after the court found that Nkabinde was not honest with the court in a number of telephonic exchanges between him and Tshabalala's attorney Mpesi Makhanya. He added that Nkabinde said the case against Tshabalala was politically motivated. Makhanya previously testified that Nkabinde told him: "My brother, I wish I could assist that brother (Tshabalala). He must be out on bail and not in detention. Nkabinde denied these allegations in a sworn affidavit. Tshabalala, who has been charged with fraud, theft and corruption relating to the submission of alleged fraudulent invoices to the tune of R563 005 for blinds and curtains for safe houses in Pretoria, claimed that he paid the money to the distributor.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
