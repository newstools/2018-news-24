Police spokesperson, Captain Jackson Manatha, said in a statement in Saturday police believed the fire had been started sometime between Thursday evening and Friday morning. He said when the school's management had left the school on Thursday evening everything had been fine, with four classrooms still open as some learners were using these rooms for their studies. "The principal of the school was then alerted telephonically during the early hours of Friday that the school was on fire," Manatha said. Manatha said the school had suffered extensive damage, including the computers in the school's information technology classroom and school furniture valued at around R95 000. He said two school offices had also been burnt. Manatha said no-one had been arrested as yet and appealed to anyone with information to contact the Centane Police on 047 498 5400 or Crime Stop on 08600 10111. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
