MOUNT Fletcher police conducted a crime awareness campaign at the rural school of Ramafole High School in Mount Fletcher on Tuesday. The campaign was held after a number of cases of drugs and dagga use were reported in rural schools. SAPS spokesman Captain Raphael Motloung said many schools in Matatiele and Mount Fletcher have reported incidents of pupils who use drugs and carry knives during school hours. He said Ramafole High was one of the schools facing the crisis. “We want to turn schools into learning areas not crime zones. “Instead of doing operations in schools, we decided to educate pupils about the dangers of using drugs to make their future brighter,” he said. School principal, teachers and pupils appreciated the good work done by SAPS. — Supplied
