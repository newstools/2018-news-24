Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court heard an application to confirm two declaratory orders of constitutional invalidity, made by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria on December 8. The High Court declared former president Jacob Zuma's conduct as unconstitutional in the termination of Mxolisi Nxasana's appointment as the then National Director of Public Prosecutions. Nxasana accepted a golden handshake of R17.3m from Zuma after a break down in their relationship.

It was also revealed that Nxasana did not want to resign from his position, but circumstances eventually pushed him to. He told Zuma that he would only resign if he paid him out for the remaining years of his contract. The court also found that the appointment of Abrahams into Nxasana's position was unconstitutional.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
