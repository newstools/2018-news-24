According to the City, officers attached to its gang and drug task team as well as its stabilisation unit responded to a complaint of people gambling, drinking and smoking dagga on a street corner in the area just before 21:00 on Saturday. "It was during the pursuit of the suspects that a member of the public apparently tried to obstruct officers, but fell and hit his head," it said in a statement. "The officers attempted to assist the injured person on the scene but decided to take the man to hospital as a crowd had gathered and the situation was becoming hostile." The man was taken to Heideveld Day Hospital where he was treated, but later died as a result of his injuries. The City said it was "deeply perturbed" by allegations that the man had been deliberately harmed by officers. "We are investigating this matter internally and we are also cooperating fully with the South African Police Service to get to the bottom of the incident." Provincial police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk confirmed the death of a 44-year-old man. "A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the cause of death. A case of murder has been registered for investigation," he said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
