The case of Tashleema Brandt and Cameron Adams was postponed to September 6 for further investigation, National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said. Brandt is out on R500 bail and Adams is in custody. Adams also has an unrelated pending rape case.

News24 previously reported that Adams struggled with tik (methamphetamine) addiction and had allegedly stolen his mother's cellphone the night before the incident. She believed he had taken it to a nearby drug house because he apparently told her he needed R30 to get it back. Adams' mother, Eleanor, said at the time that Adams and his girlfriend had left in the early hours of the morning to go and retrieve the stolen goods, even though she told her son not to leave because she was exhausted and didn't trust herself to stay awake and keep an eye on the girls.
