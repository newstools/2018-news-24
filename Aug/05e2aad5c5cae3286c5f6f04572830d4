Sesona Ngqakamba It's not often that a school can brag about having twins on its premises, let alone in each grade. However, one primary school in a disadvantaged rural area in KwaZulu-Natal has the bragging rights to 21 sets of twins, and they can be found in Grade 1 all the way to Grade 7. Nqobane Primary school will be hosting an event on Friday to celebrate this rarity, in partnership with non-profit organisation Ukuphila Kwesizwe. "It is very rare to find a school that has sets of twins in every grade and we decided to celebrate them, along with teachers and the parents who deal with these kids on a daily basis," the NPO's general manager Mdu Mabaso said. He said the goal of the celebration was to also empower the children and impact on their academic progress and lives.

"We never acknowledge the trouble they go through while raising the twins. As an organisation, we understand the dynamics of the challenges faced by this community and its effects on these young people, and we recognise the unique opportunity this discovery of such a number of twins in one school presents to the children themselves and the community at large," Mabaso said. Nqobane Primary School is situated in a rural area of Mangangeni, in Zwelibomvu, with many of the learners coming from disadvantaged backgrounds.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
