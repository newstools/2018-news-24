Goldstone appeared briefly in the Pietermaritzburg Magistrate’s Court on Friday where he was charged with the murders of Patricia O’Connor, Roland Heathcote and Patricia Tugwell, who were killed in July. It is alleged that, after killing the elderly victims, Goldstone then raided their apartments, helping himself to whatever he could carry before fleeing from the scene. Goldstone also faces three charges of housebreaking. Prosecutor Patty David told the court that Goldstone wished to plead guilty in regard to all of the charges that he faced. “The investigating officer will liaise with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) office regarding the plea,” said David, adding that, when the case was back in court on August 20, the state would prove that Goldstone is linked to all the crimes by his fingerprints and DNA. Goldstone abandoned his bail application and is being held at the Loop Street Police Station. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
