Iavan Pijoos University of Limpopo students this week walked out of an Educational Philosophy test. According to the university's acting spokesperson Johannes Selepe, videos of the walk out, which were doing the rounds on social media, were authentic. However, Selepe could not confirm that the walk out was due to the test that was "too difficult" as some social media commentators claimed. Selepe explained that the students stormed out of the test, which was scheduled to take place at 18:00 on Tuesday evening. "At the moment, we are still doing investigation which we are hoping we can conclude by tomorrow (Thursday). From there, we will have a way forward," Selepe said. He said none of the students completed the test.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
