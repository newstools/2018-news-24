De Lille and DA leader Mmusi Maimane are due to hold a press conference at 12:00 in Cape Town to make "an important announcement". Senior DA sources have revealed that De Lille and the party have agreed that she will stay on as mayor for three more months until October 31. She will then leave her post and will remain a member of the party. As a result, the proposed open disciplinary hearings due to be held against her will fall away. The separate council investigation into alleged mismanagement in the city, conducted by law firm Bowman Gilfillan, will continue however, as that is not a party matter. Some members in the DA's Cape Town caucus told News24 they were not happy with the outcome. De Lille herself had been calling for the open disciplinary hearings, and many wanted her to stay to face the charges against her, one source said. It will however give council an opportunity to start afresh from November 1 while "surviving" her leadership for another few months. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
