Goldstone has been sentenced to three life terms for the murder three elderly
people in Pietermaritzburg last month. The Pietermaritzburg
Regional Court also handed down another 15 years, each for four counts of
robbery and five years on two counts of house breaking and theft per incident. “His
sentence came after the court heard how he brutally robbed and killed the
senior citizens in Pietermaritzburg last month,” said KZN SAPS spokesperson, Lt
Colonel Thulani Zwane. Last week, DRUM magazine reported
on how Kershwin allegedly killed an 89-year-old woman at an old age home in
PMB. The suspect allegedly took
a TV set and jewellery before fleeing the scene. He was later arrested for
murder. However, it turned out the
89-year-old was not his only victim. In another incident, Kershwin had killed two
elderly people last month at an old age home in PMB. Lt Zwane revealed that the
suspect entered two different old age homes where he ransacked the house and
stole some belongings of his victims. “He attacked the victims
by strangling and stabbing them with scissors before fleeing the scene. He was
positively linked to three murders that were reported last month,” said Lt
Zwane. He added that the suspect is
still being profiled to check if he is linked to other house breaking cases
reported in the CBD and surrounding areas. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
