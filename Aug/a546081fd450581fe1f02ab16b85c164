Cape Town fire spokesperson Theo Layne said they attended to the house in Tulip Street around 22:32 on Wednesday, while provincial police said officers attended the scene just after midnight on Thursday. "According to reports, a petrol bomb was thrown at the house and one shot was also fired in that direction. The house burnt down during the incident," said police spokesperson Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana. No one was injured and no arrests have been made. Police are investigating a case of attempted murder. Lentegeur Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Byron de Villiers told News24 they believed the attack might be linked to a fight between the Junior Cisco Yakkies and the Fancy Boys. "The very same house had a hand grenade thrown at it a few weeks ago. Before that, another petrol bomb was thrown there [earlier this year]," he said. De Villiers said there had recently been several shootings in Lentegeur and Woodlands. He said police visibility had increased. The CPF was expected to hold a candlelight vigil against the ongoing gang violence, on Eisleben Drive on Friday evening. "Eisleben [Drive] separates the two gangs and we have one community blaming another community. We are saying: 'Let's get both out and show that everybody is not supporting gang violence,'" he said. "We are hoping it makes an impact and that it shows people still care." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
