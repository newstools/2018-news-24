The man, 25, had parked his Silver Toyota Yaris on the corner of Rissik and Pritchard Streets on Tuesday evening to buy food at McDonalds, Johannesburg Central police spokesperson, Captain Xoli Mbele, said on Sunday. When he returned to the vehicle, he realised two bags were missing.

Mbele said the man apparently then questioned the 26-year-old car guard about his bags and they got into a fight. He allegedly assaulted the guard with his fists before driving off. Paramedics arrived at the scene and declared the guard dead. Mbele said the man handed himself over to the police on Friday after they visited his home in Alexandra. "We are appealing to the community to refrain from taking law into their own hands if crime is committed. Report the incident to the police," he said.
