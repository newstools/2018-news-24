According to the police, two unknown suspects allegedly flagged down a minibus taxi, pretending to be passengers, got inside and allegedly shot the driver without saying a word before fleeing on foot. The driver sustained a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. Residents in the area said the driver was coming from the Canelands area, going to Verulam, when the two armed men stopped him. Chairperson of the Verulam Community Policing Forum Duncan Dube sent his condolences to the family of the driver. “We are concerned about the increasing number of taxi drivers being killed in our society. We appeal to our residents and taxi drivers that whenever there is a problem in the industry, they should resolve it without resorting violence,” Dube said. Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said: “The motive of the killing is unknown. A case of murder has been opened at Verulam police station and no arrest has been made.” The police could not confirm if the incident was related to taxi violence. Another driver was shot dead and his companion injured after unknown men opened fire on their vehicle last month in Waterloo. The man, who was identified as a taxi boss, was shot multiple times and died at the scene. Another driver (27) was shot and wounded in a drive-by shooting on the Old Main Road at the steel bridge in Verulam in March. The motive for the attack in both incidents is not yet known. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
