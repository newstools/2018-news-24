"Yes, the body found has been confirmed as Siyabonga Gabela," head of operations Mike Anderson-Reade told News24 on Tuesday. Anderson-Reade said Gabela's family had also been notified. READ: KZN Sharks Board boat survivors have nightmares after tragedy He added that a memorial service would be held on Thursday. Gabela was one of three employees who drowned when their boat capsized during a shark net inspection at Richards Bay's Newark Beach on August 8. The incident happened at about 07:00. Boat skipper Richard Gumede, and another colleague Mandlakayise Gumede, were buried this past weekend. Their colleagues Eric Buthelezi and Sqiniseko Ngobese survived the horrific incident. They told journalists last Thursday that they were still reeling after their ordeal. The two said they still had nightmares and were struggling to accept what had happened. Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said an inquest docket was being investigated by Richards Bay police following the discovery of the body. Zwane, however, declined to confirm whether it was Gabela's body, pending DNA results. The Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs said the board had not had a fatal boat accident since it was formed more than 60 years ago.
