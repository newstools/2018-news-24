MEMBERS of Kouga’s Community Services Standing Committee recently made another oversight visit to the municipality’s Traffic Department in Humansdorp. The team, led by Portfolio Chairperson Daniel Benson, visited the section to check what progress had been made since the February visit, led by late Executive Mayor Elza van Lingen. Other committee members present, were Willem Gertenbach, Timothy Jantjes and Zolani Mayoni. Benson said the municipal leadership had taken steps to improve services and customer care at the Traffic Department and it was important for the committee to monitor the progress. “Even though the committee has been receiving progress reports, it is important for us, as public representatives, to have first-hand experience of what we are talking about and to see where further interventions are necessary,” he said. Benson added that the committee members were pleased with the progress that had been made to convert the old Council chambers at the department into a work station better suited to service delivery. The municipality runs the licensing service, as an agent, on behalf of the Department of Transport and it is them who issue the machines and accredit the trained staff members. The Portfolio Chairperson also encouraged people to make use of the telephone booking system and clarified that this did not automatically secure a testing date for a learner’s or driving licence candidate. “The booking system allows you to make a specific date and time when you can visit the Traffic Department to finalise your appointment for a licence test. “Once you are at the Traffic Department for the slot you have booked, you first need to complete the eye test and have your fingerprints captured on the LEU, so that a test date can be reserved for you through the eNaTIS system,” said Benson. He said learner’s licence tests and vehicle licence renewals could also be done at the Hankey satellite station at the municipal offices in the town.
