"He [Abrahams] indicated that he wanted to be given an opportunity to clear his office this week. He is not working. Remember he worked for the NPA for 23 years. When he was appointed to this position, he moved from another office," NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said. Mfaku said Abrahams also had to do a handover with newly-appointed acting prosecutions boss Silas Ramaite. "He [Abrahams] is also engaging with Dr Ramaite on matters where he has historical knowledge," Mfaku said.
