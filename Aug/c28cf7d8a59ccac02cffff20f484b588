"He left an indelible mark in the industry and will be remembered for his excellent work, including raising awareness on the injustices in South Africa during the dark days of apartheid,” said Tom. Tom said Ntshona’s immense contribution to the liberation struggle, using art to expose the evils and atrocities of the apartheid system, was well documented. She went on to say that Ntshona's love for the youth had been shown in the way he trained and mentored young actors.   Tom, on behalf of the committee, has joined the nation in extending heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and the creative industry. Ntshona, 77, died on Thursday, following an illness. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
