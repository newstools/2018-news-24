His firearm was taken. Constable Lonwabo Kili, 30, had been stationed at the Bellville South police station. In the second incident, another off-duty police constable was shot twice in the head outside the residence of a friend in Site B, Khayelitsha, police confirmed. Constable Siyamcela Ncipa,37, worked at Mowbray SAPS. His firearm was stolen during the incident. Western Cape Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula expressed shock at the murders and also extended his condolences to the family. “It is disturbing to observe that criminals have no regard for human life. Not even police officers are spared as they also fall prey to these attacks,” Jula said, adding police would “work around the clock to get [the] perpetrators”. Anyone with information on the murders is urged to contact police.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
