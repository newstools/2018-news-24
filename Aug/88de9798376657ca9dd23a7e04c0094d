he never received. The man, who doesn't want to be named, told YOU he bought
the French bulldog as a birthday gift for his wife, whose birthday was on August
23. "I searched the internet for a puppy and found a man
called Robert Bull from Durban who claimed to sell the breed," he says. "I ordered the puppy in July for delivery in August. In
that time the man insisted on money to cover costs such as sterilising the
puppy, for deworming medicine, various licenses for the dog, as well as
transport costs. From July to August I steadily paid more and more money. "In August I became suspicious and insisted the man
send me a picture of the puppy. He was unable to, and I realised something was
fishy. "Shortly thereafter the man removed his details from
the internet and disappeared. I never heard from him again and I've been unable
to find him." The man says his wife is extremely upset about the scam. "We won't be looking for a puppy again anytime soon. It's
going to take a while to recover from this. "I just hope the guy's caught," he says. Police spokesperson Captain Raymond Deokaran confirmed a
fraud case is being investigated. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
