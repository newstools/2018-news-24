The officers had been patrolling the area around 18:00 when they heard gunshots, said Brigadier Jay Naicker. They spotted two men with firearms who fled along a railway line. The men fired shots at the officers. One officer, 36, was shot dead, while his colleague, 28, was shot in the leg. "A manhunt is underway for the suspects. All police experts are still on the scene," said Naicker. Acting provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi vowed to track down the killers. "We will not rest until they are found and we will leave no stone unturned in the process. We are also appealing to the community to come forward and expose these thugs. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family of the late police officer and we wish our colleague in hospital a speedy recovery." 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
