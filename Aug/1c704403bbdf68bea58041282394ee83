"It's still very sketchy what happened there. We have started an investigation and we are working closely with the police," said spokesperson Willa de Ruyter. "From what we understand there was a shooting incident in which a person was fatally injured. "That is part of the police investigation. They have opened a murder docket." Comment was not immediately available from the police. Vote rigging allegations The shooting at TUT's Soshanguve North campus came amid allegations of vote rigging just before voting stations closed. The campus rector suspended classes for Friday and the university would help police find out how the man was shot, and also work with the independent voting body to probe the rigging allegations. The campus would still be accessible. A fire was also started at some of the facilities and an assessment is under way. The university also wants to know how a firearm got on to the campus. "We have weapon free institutions, so we don't allow weapons on campus," said De Ruyter. Those contesting the elections across TUT campuses this year included representatives of the SA Students Congress (Sasco), Pan Africanist Students Organisation, the Economic Freedom Fighters' Student Command and the Congress of People.
