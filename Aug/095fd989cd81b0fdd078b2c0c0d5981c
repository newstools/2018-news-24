She reportedly checked into the guest house and asked for a late checkout the following morning. A few hours later, she called the owner, crying, and told him what had happened. He called the police and the paramedics. Prins allegedly gave her son medication meant for adults before smothering him to death. She then apparently attempted to commit suicide by slitting her wrists and throat. At her first court appearance, the Morningside mother indicated through her lawyer that she intended to plead guilty. Previously, she left the dock sobbing and, as she went down the steps to the cells below, was heard wailing: "I am so alone... I am so alone in prison."
