Nkwalase said the four people were each released on R5 000 bail, with strict conditions. The case was postponed to October 18 for further investigation, Nkwalase added. This, after the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation Unit, in partnership with the provincial departments of transport and traffic, pounced on a syndicate allegedly implicated in the processing of fraudulent vehicle certificates in the province. Nkwalase said more arrests were expected. According to Nkwalase, it is alleged that Brent Taylor and Omar Jacobs, vehicle examiners at the Athlone Testing Centre, were allegedly involved in the issuing of fraudulent roadworthy certificates for vehicles. He added that David Makrieling allegedly acted as a recruiter in the Swartland area, while Gawie Settley allegedly recruited clients in the West Coast area. The certificates were believed to have been issued even though the vehicles were not tested, Nkwalase said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
