News24 previously reported that a 40-year-old man was shot on the corner of Jakkalsvlei Avenue and Jakes Gerwel Drive during a taxi meeting on Saturday. He later died in hospital. The protest will take place between 05:00 and 10:00 on the intersections of Jakkalsvlei Avenue and Jakes Gerwel Drive, Bluegum Road and Jakes Gerwel Drive, and Jakkalsveli Avenue and Valhalla Drive. Ward councillor Angus McKenzie said that the protest, of no more than 250 people, would not obstruct pedestrian entrances or traffic. "Traffic will flow as per usual, as the people have been permitted to picket on the pavement. Public Order Policing and Traffic Services will be closely monitoring the protest," he said. "The biggest issue that I have had to deal with was to ensure that the protest is protected and legal. If there are criminal elements, they must be dealt with by the authorities." He added that those attending the protest had been advised to remain peaceful. On Sunday, the Western Cape Flying Squad apprehended eight suspects in a white minibus and recovered a 9mm pistol inside the vehicle. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said that the shooting had taken place during a meeting between two taxi associations and prospective members. The initial charge of attempted murder was amended to murder after the victim died in hospital.
