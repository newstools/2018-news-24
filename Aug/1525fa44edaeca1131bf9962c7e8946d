does not intend to usurp traditional initiation while formulating the Customary
Initiation Bill, said the chairperson for the Portfolio Committee on
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs. Richard Mdakane on Sunday
reassured traditional leaders, saying their contribution to the bill would be
vital. "Chiefs work well with us
and we love them. Their authority is guaranteed in the constitution. Through
this piece of legislation, we are doing something for the nation. We can't have
a culture that brings tears to the people," Mdakane said. Mdakane said the committee would
invite chiefs and kings to Parliament, once the current process is finalised, "to get input from them on how
best to practice the tradition". The committee held its public
hearings into the bill in Rustenburg, where people emphasised the difference between medical circumcision and
traditional initiation, as well as the role of the chiefs in the tradition. Mdakane said it concerned
Parliament when culture was distorted and "often told from the perspective
of people who have no interest in the
culture". "Distortion causes havoc. It
is important for society to understand what is being taught at initiation
schools. The content of the schools should be proper, such that parents feel at
ease when their children are at initiation schools." Mdakane said culture was about
the development of society. "We want to return better
men and women from these schools. This bill provokes discussions throughout the
country," he said. The public hearings move to
Limpopo on Monday, with Mpumalanga and Gauteng on Tuesday.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
