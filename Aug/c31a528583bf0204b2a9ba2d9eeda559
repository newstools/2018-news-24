Watch.WATCH A group of people have invaded a wine farm in Stellenbosch and erected informal structures, despite being evicted from the same area several months ago. Police spokesperson, Captain FC van Wyk, confirmed that there was a land invasion on a farm in the Cloetesville precinct, neighbouring the Kayamandi informal settlement. Van Wyk said the invasion had started last week and confirmed that this was the second incident on this piece of land. He said the farm owner had previously sought a court interdict and had invaders evicted during an attempt to settle on the land in May. "The sheriff has to execute the eviction order once it’s available. POPS and other Law Enforcement agencies are on the scene monitoring the situation and to prevent further invasion," he said. News24 understand that the farmland in question is part of the Louiesenhof Wine Estate. A person, who did not want to give his name when News24 called the estate, said the latest invasion had started last week Saturday and that the invaders had already set up a number of structures on the land. Stellenbosch municipal manager Geraldine Mettler confirmed to News24 that the owner of the estate had opened a case of trespassing and is seeking another urgent court interdict. "The municipality has interdicts on municipal land is monitoring the situation carefully," she said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
