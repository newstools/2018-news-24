Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the incident happened on August 6. Mabona said the learners were consuming "what looked like water in a squeeze bottle" during Period One. "During Period Two of Maths Literature, a teacher observed the suspicious behaviour of the [pupils] and immediately called the principal to intervene." "It was discovered that the [pupils] were drunk and they were escorted to the principal's office by other [pupils] because they could not walk by themselves," Mabona said.  In the video that went viral on social media, a pupil who appeared to be drunk, struggled to keep her balance. She later held onto a wall. The people in the background could be heard saying: "Stop holding onto the wall. Walk on your own. Why are you drinking at school?" Mabona said the pupil was trying to run away from the principal. He said their parents were immediately contacted and informed about the incident. They are expected to face a disciplinary hearing on August 16. Disciplinary proceedings have also been instituted against the teacher who captured the video. "We urge all our [pupils] to refrain from acts of misconduct in schools and implore parents to assist the department in instilling [pupil] discipline in and outside the school environment," Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
