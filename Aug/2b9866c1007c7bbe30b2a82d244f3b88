"At 07:20…NSRI Station 6 Port Elizabeth were alerted to a dolphin stranded on Cape Recife beach," said NSRI spokesperson Andrew Ingram in a statement. "Sea Rescue Volunteers, Bay World staff and members of the Nelson Mandela Bay Marine Animal Stranding Network responded straight to the scene where they found a Common Dolphin well up on the beach." The female dolphin was placed on a special stretcher and taken to the sea rescue station.  A boat was then prepared to take her back into the water. "We transported her approximately 4 nautical miles out to sea where she was released." "We are cautiously optimistic that she will survive the ordeal," said Port Elizabeth NSRI Station Commander Ian Gray.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
