De Aar Solar Power proudly vows their support to a local non-governmental organisation’s gender equality campaign which aims to help to provide equal access to education for girls. The programme, Pad for Girls, promises to help disadvantaged teenager girls to return to the classroom. According to research, it has been reported that over 80% of South African girls miss three to five days of schooling monthly due to the lack of access to sanitary products. The reality is that while the pressure is mounting on government to provide free sanitary products to women and girls of poor communities, the solution has been left in the hands of non-governmental organisations and corporate sponsors for now. “Young girls often choose not to attend school due to discomfort as they do not have the means of buying sanitary products,” said Hlengiwe Radebe, economic develop­ment manager for De Aar Solar Power. De Aar Solar Power recently funded the purchase of over 2 000 packs of sanitary products to assist the local campaign. The sanitary products, part of a care pack, were distributed to high schools in De Aar. The five schools reportedly visited during the campaign drive on Friday, 27 July, are the Orion High School, St John’s, Emthanjeni, Monwabisi and the Veritas High School.
