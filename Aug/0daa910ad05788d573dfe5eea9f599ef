the Wild Coast Sun Golf Course that threatened the tournament's continuation. Sun International issued a press
statement on Sunday saying "a group of individuals with spades damaged
sections of the course including a number of the greens". "There were no
witnesses to the incident, but messages left on some of the course flags
indicated that this was the beginning of further
planned action." The hotel group said
groundskeepers were currently repairing the damage saying that the Sunshine Tour
event will go ahead as scheduled. Thomas Abt, deputy commissioner of the Sunshine Tour, told
Netwerk24 it was a mystery who was responsible or why it was done. There were
no eye witnessess, he said. He said the damage was done at
the 12th and 17th hole
and thus only the first nine would be used on Monday. Professional golfer Michael
Hollick however posted on Facebook claiming the "local community"
were responsible. "So the local community near
the Wild Coast Sun weren’t happy about
something so what do they do.... they go onto the golf course and dig up the
last 6 greens!! Boggles my mind what goes through the heads of some people.....
apparently there were some staff fired for illegal striking this past week and this
was their retaliation." Hollick did not respond to
request for further comment. Sunshine Tour Chief Operations
Officer Grant Wilson did not immediately comment. Police did not immediately
comment.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
