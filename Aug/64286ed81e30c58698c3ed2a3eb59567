Kauthar Gool An Uber driver in Florida in the US won’t face charges for killing a man who threatened him when he drove a drunk woman home from a bar in Winter Haven on 28 August, reports Daily Mail. Robert Westlake (38) – who’d recently finished his police force training – was confronted by Jason Boek when the Uber driver drove the inebriated woman home. After a heated text message exchange with his on-again, off-again girlfriend, who wasn’t the woman Westlake was ferrying home, Boek pulled his vehicle in front of the taxi, believing his girlfriend was inside. The 34-year-old then got out of his vehicle and said, “You know I've got a pistol? Do you want me to f**king shoot you?” Boek didn’t have a gun and instead held his cellphone in his hand. But Westlake didn’t know that and as the younger man approached the vehicle the older man shot him in the chest, reports the BBC. After the shooting, the Uber driver called 911 and tried to perform CPR. Extra Sources: Daily Mail, BBC   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
