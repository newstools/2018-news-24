Riaan Grobler Two convicted criminals escaped from police custody on Friday morning while being transported from Ellisras to Polokwane. Colonel Sakkie Louwrens told News24 that Petrus Moyo and Witness Shimango broke the roof of the moving police vehicle and jumped out in Marken, Limpopo. "One is a convicted murderer and the other a house robber," said Louwrens. Louwrens said it was unclear how the men had managed to break the roof, but it was believed that they may have "kicked it". According to Louwrens, the men had fled on foot. In November, Moyo also escaped from police custody in Lephalale. News24 reported at the time that Moyo was part of a group of armed men who fatally shot Dr Werner Emslie and also injured his wife - who is also a doctor – during a farm attack on September 20. Anyone with information of the men's whereabouts is urged to contact Louwrens on 071 798 7954. Wanted: Petrus Moyo and Witness Shimango excaped from police custody while in transit.
