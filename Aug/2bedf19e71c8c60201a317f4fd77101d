British condom-maker Durex is withdrawing some of its products early from shelves after determining they do not meet "burst pressure" standards as they near their expiry date. The recall of certain latex-free condoms was posted on the company's website in Germany a week ago along with similar recalls in Britain and elsewhere, but was first reported in the media on Tuesday. If customers have experienced the condom failure the company refers them to the advice on the packaging to "seek doctor or pharmacist assistance as soon as possible". Durex says customers can send back unused condoms or return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. Information on identifying possibly defective condoms can be found on the Durex websites in Britain or Germany. KEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to
