In a statement released on Friday, department spokesperson Steve Mabona said parents should visit www.gdeadmissions.gov.za to accept or reject the offers of placement within seven working days. If parents lost their login credentials (username and password) they can call the department's call centre on 0800 000 789 or visit the nearest district office, Mabona said. "Failure to respond to the offer of placement will result in the forfeiture of the offer to the next applicant on the waiting list." He added: "Parents with pending status on the system are requested to be patient; offers will be issued throughout the placement period." Mabona also said parents who failed to submit the required documents to schools between April 16 and June 5 were requested to submit documents at district offices from Monday, September 10 to Friday, September 14. "These applicants and all those who could not be placed by schools due to capacity will be placed by districts." The department plans to place all Grade 1 and 8 pupils for the 2019 academic year by October 31, Mabona added. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
