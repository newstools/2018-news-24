Heilie Combrinck IN a third incident within a month’s time, armed robbers have during the early morning hours struck a house in Uitenhage. Three men armed with a firearm and knives targeted a house in Mimosa Drive on Tuesday at 02:50. According to Captain Gerda Swart, spokesperson of Uitenhage police, a mere month ago armed robbers struck a house in Katjiepiering Street (Strelitzia Park) during the early morning hours. A few days later, also during the early hours armed robbers   targeted a house in Mimonsa Drive (Fairbridge Heights) and now again in Mimosa Drive. According to police information, the three unknown males entered the main house through an open window and threatened the occupants with a firearm and knives. The suspects demanded money and took a flat screen television set, jewellery and electrical appliances. “It is alleged that the occupants of a flat were woken up by the screams of the occupants of the main house and they alerted the Uitenhage police,” said Captain Swart. “Police officials responded immediately and upon entering the premises, the suspects allegedly fired several shots at the police. Police members returned fire and the suspects fled in different directions on foot into the adjacent bushes.” Police officials recovered the television in the bushes in front of the house afterwards. No one sustained any injuries during the incident. “We appeal to residents to lock all doors and windows, especially windows without burglar bars and to install and to activate an alarm system during the night,” said Captain Swart. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
