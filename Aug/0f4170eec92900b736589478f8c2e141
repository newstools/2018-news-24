Organised by film maker, Dr Leanne Brady, the film was screened in Tafelsig on Saturday followed by food, fun and activities including live entertainment and karaoke­. The film was screened in Tafelsig because it is about the experiences of paramedics in Mitchell’s Plain and focuses on paramedic Abdul Waheem Martin who is from Tafelsig (“Life of life savers”, People’s Post, 7 August). The film was screened on a large, cinema style screen with residents receiving free popcorn and treats. Under immense pressure and with the constant threat to their own lives, paramedics working in the classified red zones have a mammoth task when working to uphold their call to save lives. Red Zone Paramedics, a short film following the night shift of an ambulance crew in Mitchell’s Plain on one of the busiest nights of the year, will be screened for free to residents next week. Hundreds of residents were joined by local councillor Sheval Arendse, police, the local subforum members and the Community policing forum. Toni Stuart, a local poet, also performed three poems about the lives of paramedics. Residents were then able to ask questions around their daily activities.   24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
