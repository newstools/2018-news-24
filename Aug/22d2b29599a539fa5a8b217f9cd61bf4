president David Mabuza says government
will have a "zero tolerance attitude to crimes against women and
children". "We are gripped by the pain
and suffering not as natives nor Africans, but as people, South Africans of a
country reborn, black and white, united against the abuse of women and
children," Mabuza said. Mabuza was delivering the keynote
address at the National Day of Prayer at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg on
Saturday. Mabuza said the country was suffering
from pain at the hands of men who “grievously abuse the most vulnerable in our
society”. "It is out of their
shrilling cries and winches of pain that we register their call that enough is enough." "Many women are suffering.
We may not know them. We may never see them but we know they exist, for
violence in our nation has a face, the face of a woman," he said. He said justice must be done,
adding that government must work hard to "enhance the responsiveness of
our criminal justice system so that women are protected from all indignities
perpetrated against them". "The ANC as the governing party, is fully committed to gender parity and
gender equality as a precondition for economic freedom in our lifetime. We
understand that women are the soul and fire, not just of the ANC, but of our
nation," he said. "We have to hear their
cries. We have to feel their pain. We have to heal their wounds."  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
