Constable Ncipa,37, from Site B, was based at the Mowbray police station for nine years, was gunned down outside a friend’s house last Saturday morning. He leaves behind his wife and three children. The off-duty policeman was shot twice in the head before being robbed of his service firearm. Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula has expressed shock in the murder. “Constable Siyamcela Ncipa 37 was shot twice in the head and his firearm was robbed during the incident. The perpetrators will be hunted down and they will face the(full) might of the law,”he said. Jula said detectives from the Hawks have taken over the investigations. “It is disturbing to observe that criminals have no regard for human life, not even police officers are sparred as they also fall prey to these attacks. Ours is to work around the clock to get to perpetrators,” said Jula. Amanda Ncipa, sister of the deceased, said the incident has left them in shock. “I received a call about three in the morning that my brother was shot at in L Section. I couldn’t believe it. I immediately went straight to his house and on my arrival some family members were already at the scene,” she said. She described her brother as a humble person who loved people and the community at large. “I wish his killers can be apprehended and rot in jail,” she stated. Siyamcela’s wife Lihlume Ncipa,32, said she wants justice to be done. “I wish I can meet the perpetrators and ask them why they killed my husband? My husband has left a big vacuum in the family. He loved his children and his work,” she said, sobbing. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
