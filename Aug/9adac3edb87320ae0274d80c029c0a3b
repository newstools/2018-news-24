Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona said they visited the school on Tuesday.

We condemn it in the strongest form." In the Facebook video, a pupil is seen approaching the teacher and touching his face, while others in the classroom laugh. The teacher brushes the pupil off. Later, in a portion of the video clip, the pupil can be seen walking back to his desk before looking at the person taking the video. He appears to laugh and makes hand gestures commonly associated with a street gang. A few seconds later, he appears to grab the teacher's buttocks while someone can be heard laughing in the background. "The two boys were suspended. The second boy is the one who was filming the video. Learners are urged to abide by the school code of conduct and desist from any acts of misdemeanor," Mabona said. Mabona said the pupil in the video apologised to the teacher and the classroom.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
