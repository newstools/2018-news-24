WATCH One person has been shot dead while a tractor was set alight in a violent service delivery protest in Colenso, KwaZulu-Natal, police said on Monday. A truck was also hijacked and looted during the protest, according to KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele. Mbele said Colenso residents went on a rampage on Sunday night and barricaded the R74 between Colenso and Weenen with rocks. "When police officers attempted to open the road, they were stoned and shot at while police vehicles were damaged during the incident," she said. Mbele said while police were busy on the R74 another group threatened a security guard who was guarding the tractor loader backhoe along the R103 and set it alight. "The group went on to hijack a truck which was then looted of its load and used to close off the roadway," she said. Mbele said when police responded to the scene on the R103 they were met with gunfire and were forced to retaliate. "One person was treated for a gunshot wound on the scene and later died in hospital. Colenso police are investigating a case of inquest, public violence and malicious damage to property," Mbele said. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
