It is alleged that the 42-year-old constable had arrested the 22-year-old complainant on August 5 for drinking in public, IPID spokesperson Moses Dlamini said. "While in custody, she gave her cellphone number to the suspect, who is stationed at the same police station in the Community Service Centre. Apparently, the two were communicating via WhatsApp text." Dlamini said the officer sent the woman a message on Monday in which he asked her to visit him in the Bloemfontein area. "The victim was allegedly taken to the police officer’s place of residence where she was raped." He is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
