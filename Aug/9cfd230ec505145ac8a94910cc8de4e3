"A convicted criminal should not be allowed to perform at public events, especially a rapist. He violated a woman. How could they give him a platform during Women's Month? Do they care about profit more than women?" #NotInMyName secretary general Themba Masango told News24. #NotInMyNameSA is not alone as South Africans across the board continue to speak out against the decision by Mzansi Kwaito & House Music Awards promoters to include Brickz in their line up. National Assembly member Tim Brauteseth hit out at the organisers of the event on Twitter.  Radio presenter Gugulethu Mhlungu wrote on the social media platform that the promoters' defence that Brickz hadn't killed anyone spoke volumes.  Awards CEO Perfecta Khumalo's comments on eNCA regarding the planned performance also angered journalist Andisiwe Makinana.  The Department of Correctional Services told News24 that it still needed to verify with Brickz's parole officer regarding his bail conditions and whether he was allowed to perform. "It is highly unlikely that he would go and perform without authorisation, but I still need to verify this," department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said on Friday morning. Joburg City Theatre declined to comment, saying it offered the venue on a rental basis and was not responsible for the Mzansi Kwaito & House Music Awards lineup.
