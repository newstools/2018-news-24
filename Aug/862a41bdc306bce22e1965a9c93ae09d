27-year-old man has been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping his aunt in
2015. According
to police reports the rapist was raised by his aunt but when he started becoming
involved in criminal activities the victim disapproved and subsequently chased
him from her home. However,
in September 2015 KZN SAPS Colonel Thembeka Mbele told Drum that the accused
approached his aunt whilst she was sleeping at her home in the Mathukuza area
in Newcastle. “He
repeatedly raped her, stabbed her multiple times, strangled her and robbed her
of cash before fleeing. The victim was taken to hospital in a critical a
condition,” explained Mbele. After
the incident, the accused left the province. A
case of rape and attempted murder was opened at the Newcastle police station
and assigned to the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit
for investigation. “Investigators
conducted their probe which led them to Boksburg prison in the Gauteng province
in April 2017.” It
was discovered that the rapist had committed another crime in the East Rand in Gauteng. “The
accused had been arrested for a murder he had committed in the area and was
being held at the prison.” He
was then taken to the Newcastle Regional Court to face his rape and attempted
murder charges. “DNA
samples also linked him to a murder case that he committed in the Fernie area
in the Mpumalanga province. The
accused was incarcerated for the duration of the trial until his successful
prosecution,” said Mbele. The
Newcastle Regional Court yesterday sentenced him to life imprisonment for
raping his aunt, ten years for attempted murder and a year imprisonment for
theft. His murder trial is still continuing in Mpumalanga. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
