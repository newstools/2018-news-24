The 17-year-old boy allegedly attacked his father after the older man placed the horse saddle in the teenager's room at their home in Cwebe, Elliotdale, on Wednesday. "The suspect did not like what was done by his father and asked why he put the saddle in his room. The suspect stabbed his father on his upper body," Manatha said.

Manatha said the boy is facing charges of murder and will appear in the Elliotdale Magistrate's Court on Friday. He added that following his arrest, the teenager was handed over to his relatives as he is still a minor. Manatha said that the identity of the father has been withheld because some family members, who live outside of Eastern Cape, are yet to be informed of his murder.
