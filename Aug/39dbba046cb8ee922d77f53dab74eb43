The commission will not sit on Wednesday and Thursday. Jonas claimed that the Guptas offered him an initial R600 000 cash, and then R600m to be given later, if he accepted the job of finance minister. He was expected to replace Nhlanhla Nene who was fired in December 2015. Jonas said he had met with former president Jacob Zuma's son Duduzane, businessman Fana Hlongwane and the eldest of the Gupta brothers, Ajay. However, the three men have all rejected the allegations. On the first day of the commission, Hlongwane’s legal representatives said he was considering appearing before the commission. The commission is now wrapping up testimony of Treasury's chief procurement officer Willie Mathebula.
