Mortimer Saunders was charged with premeditated murder and rape after the toddler's body was found in a shallow grave in Epping, an industrial area of Cape Town, several days after she went missing. If he is found guilty of premeditated murder, he could be sentenced to life in jail. However, he has only pleaded guilty to murder, which carries a lesser sentence of 15 years.

A guilty verdict of rape of a minor could result in a 15-year sentence. He was a tenant in the house where Courtney's mother, Juanita, lived.
