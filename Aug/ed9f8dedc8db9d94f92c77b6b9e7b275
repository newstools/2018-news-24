Residents of Emsindweni in Makhaza took the law into their own hands and burned to death two brothers suspected of alleged theft. Emsindweni translates to “Place of anger” in Isixhosa. The incident took place on Sunday afternoon, in the glare of the community. Captain Siyabulela Vukubi of the Harare Police Station, said: “On Sunday afternoon, police attended a crime scene at Emsindweni where they encountered two bodies of males who were burnt to death. “Initial information was that the deaths of the two are linked to theft, although no case was opened with the police­. “We strongly condemn incidents of this nature where people are brutally killed in our communities.” He said the deceased were identified as brothers Bulelani (33) and Thanduxolo Maqhina (29). Vukubi said no arrests had been made yet, and that the investigation continued. Ward 96 councillor Daniel Khatshwa also condemned the actions of the community. “We can’t take (the) law into our hands when we have (the) police for that. Burning a person alive is a barbaric act, and people must learn to let the law take its course,” he said. He said the area is relatively new, with different people from different areas, with different mindsets. He added that as much as what the residents did was wrong, he also doesn’t condone crime, if the two had committed one.
