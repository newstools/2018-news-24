Thami Ka-Nkosi FOLLOWING complaints of Ugu residents not receiving their monthly water accounts on time, the Ugu District Municipality has assured its customers that accounts would be ready to reach customers before the end of the week. It is believed that the reason behind the municipality’s failure to provide its customers with water bills is due to the newly implemented billing system, which had been experiencing technical glitches. This resulted in July’s bills not being issued to customers as per the norm. During that period, customers had to pay their monthly average usage cost, which was to be credited into their accounts accordingly once the problem was rectified and the system was back to normal functionality. “We regret that residents did not receive their monthly municipal accounts and we sincerely apologise to our customers for any inconvenience that may have been caused due to the non-issuing of the July billing accounts,” Ugu spokesperson France Zama said. Zama also added that customers may also request a balance on their municipal accounts by contacting the municipal call centre or to make payments on their average monthly consumption if no balance or statement is obtained. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
