He faces a string of charges related to Lee's murder and others relating to his ex-fiancé. He was arrested after Lee's body was discovered in a sugarcane field in New Hanover, KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, in January. Philani Ntuli was granted R40 000 bail at a previous appearance. However, during the judgment in the bail application, Magistrate Mohamed Motala stressed that it was important for him to fulfil the oath of his office without being influenced by public opinion. Motala also criticised the police and the private investigators who arrested Ntuli for not following constitutional procedures during the arrest. The court heard that the private investigators and the police had entered Ntuli's premises without a search warrant. Ntuli was not there at the time and the investigators had gained entry to his home without his knowledge, said Motala. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.
