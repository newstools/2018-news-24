WATCH A meeting on the agricultural sector and the land question between President Cyril Ramaphosa, Agricultural Business Chamber (Agbiz) and AgriSA was fruitful. This is according to Agbiz CEO Dr John Purchase, who said he and AgriSA president Dan Kriek had met with Ramaphosa and Minister in the Presidency responsible for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on Tuesday afternoon. "The purpose of the meeting was to introduce a sector-based approach to inclusive growth and employment, specifically for the agro-food value chain," said AgriSA in a statement. Kriek also emphasised the commitment of AgriSA and the Agri-Sector Unity Forum (ASUF) to resolve the land issue and other challenges confronting the primary agriculture industry. "Throughout the presentation, President Ramaphosa showed keen interest through incisive and relevant questions," he said. "The president called on leaders in the sectors to work together with government and to remain engaged through Minister Dlamini-Zuma." Both AgriSA and Agbiz met with Dlamini-Zuma earlier in August. "The meeting was cordial and constructive, and provides a solid base for further in-depth engagement on the key issues confronting the sector. The broader agro-food industry will be developing a sectoral framework for consideration by government and social partners”, Purchase said.
