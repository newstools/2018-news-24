man who is the sixth and last suspect in the 2017 murder case of actor Dumisani
Masilela. The suspect is made his first appearance
before the Benoni Magistrate Court today, 20 August 2018. Masilela was fatally shot during a
hijacking in Tembisa South. Four suspects were arrested last year while a fifth
died in a robbery. The provincial commissioner of police in
Gauteng, Deliwe de Lange, has commended an intelligence-led multi-disciplinary
team of investigators for its tireless efforts in making sure that all six
suspects were rounded up and arrested. “This successful arrest brought about by such
meticulous investigation will go a long way in ensuring that serious and
violent crimes plaguing Gauteng are reduced to their lowest level,” she said. According to a statement released by the
SAPS’s  Mathapelo Pieters, all the suspects
have been positively linked to five cases: the murder of Dumisani Masilela; hijackings
reported in Daveyton, Phokeng and Siyabuswa; and possession of a stolen phone. The other suspects are expected to go on
trial in the Pretoria High Court between 8 and 19 October 2018.  24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24. Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
