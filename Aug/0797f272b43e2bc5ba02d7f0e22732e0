The home-based care programmes of the St Teresa’s Hospice in Kimberley is offered specially to persons with life-threatening illnesses like cancer, HIV and Aids, motor neuron disease and any other life-limiting disease that falls in hospice’s criteria. Hospice offers services for care and support during terminal illness, like bed washes, pain management, wound care, assistance with clinic visits, councelling and support. Hospice also offers bereavement support and counselling. During a treatment process, hospice liaises with doctors, social workers and religious leaders as part of patients’ wellbeing. When it comes to terminal care, hospice caters for last-stage illness that has been long-standing. In this case families should notice that no active treatment is given in this regard, except treatment for symptoms. The in-patient unit offers respite care in a situation where a family member is caring for a loved one, and they need a break, has to go away or are exhausted. The patient can then be admitted for that period, for a maximum of three weeks. A fee will be charged for this period, making it crucial for all patients to have their own doctor. There is a daily tariff for in-patient care. Six beds are available for babies and juveniles and 12 for adults. Selected medical aids do pay for hospice stay, depending on the diagnosis of the patient concerned. Admission forms can be collected at reception, as well as information on necessary procedure. Free parking will be available at the St Patrick’s CBC next door.
