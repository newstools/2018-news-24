The incident took place at Govender's father's garage, where he sells cars, in Durban. Govender, who is accused of attempted murder, made a brief appearance in the Durban Magistrate's Court on Friday. Magistrate Mohamed Motala adjourned his case to September 11 for a trial. Govender is out on R7 000 bail. Zinhle's uncle, Ben Mchunu, told News24 that the family was still hurt. Ben also said his niece still could not walk properly. "She walks with the assistance of a walking stick. Her heel was badly damaged by the fire," he said. Govender allegedly poured liquid, which smelt like petrol, at Zinhle's feet and told her he would burn her. He then allegedly took out his lighter and threw it at the liquid on the floor. Zinhle's leg caught fire from the resulting flames. Zinhle, who has never attended court during Govender's appearances, previously told News24 that after the incident Govender drove her to a pharmacist who gave her painkillers and attempted to treat the wound. She was later admitted to Addington Hospital, where she stayed for a week.
